They’re versatile enough to write content, translate languages, summarize, and answer questions without needing specialized training for each task.\\nIn addition to text generation, many models support:\\n\\n Tool calling - calling external tools (like databases queries or API calls) and use results in their responses.\\n Structured output - where the model’s response is constrained to follow a defined format.\\n Multimodality - process and return data other than text, such as images, audio, and video.\\n Reasoning - models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.\\n\\nModels are the reasoning engine of agents. They drive the agent’s decision-making process, determining which tools to call, how to interpret results, and when to provide a final answer.\\nThe quality and capabilities of the model you choose directly impact your agent’s baseline reliability and performance. Different models excel at different tasks - some are better at following complex instructions, others at structured reasoning, and some support larger context windows for handling more information.\\nLangChain’s standard model interfaces give you access to many different provider integrations, which makes it easy to experiment with and switch between models to find the best fit for your use case.\\nFor provider-specific integration information and capabilities, see the provider’s chat model page.\\n\\u200bBasic usage\\nModels can be utilized in two ways:\\n\\nWith agents - Models can be dynamically specified when creating an agent.\\nStandalone - Models can be called directly (outside of the agent loop) for tasks like text generation, classification, or extraction without the need for an agent framework.\\n\\nThe same model interface works in both contexts, which gives you the flexibility to start simple and scale up to more complex agent-based workflows as needed.\\n\\u200bInitialize a model\\nThe easiest way to get started with a standalone model in LangChain is to use init_chat_model to initialize one from a chat model provider of your choice (examples below):\\n OpenAI Anthropic Azure Google Gemini AWS Bedrock HuggingFace👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\")\\n👉 Read the Anthropic chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[anthropic]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\")\\n👉 Read the Azure chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"] = \"...\"\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2025-03-01-preview\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\\n    \"azure_openai:gpt-4.1\",\\n    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],\\n)\\n👉 Read the Google GenAI chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[google-genai]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"google_genai:gemini-2.5-flash-lite\")\\n👉 Read the AWS Bedrock chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[aws]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\n# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:\\n# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\\n    \"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\",\\n    model_provider=\"bedrock_converse\",\\n)\\n👉 Read the HuggingFace chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[huggingface]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \"hf_...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\\n    \"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\",\\n    model_provider=\"huggingface\",\\n    temperature=0.7,\\n    max_tokens=1024,\\n)\\n\\nCopyresponse = model.invoke(\"Why do parrots talk?\")\\n\\nSee init_chat_model for more detail, including information on how to pass model parameters.\\n\\u200bKey methods\\nInvokeThe model takes messages as input and outputs messages after generating a complete response.\\nStreamInvoke the model, but stream the output as it is generated in real-time.\\nBatchSend multiple requests to a model in a batch for more efficient processing.\\nIn addition to chat models, LangChain provides support for other adjacent technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores. See the integrations page for details.\\n\\u200bParameters\\nA chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:\\n\\u200bmodelstringrequiredThe name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider. You can also specify both the model and its provider in a single argument using the ’:’ format, for example, ‘openai:o1’.\\n\\u200bapi_keystringThe key required for authenticating with the model’s provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. Often accessed by setting an environment variable.\\n\\u200btemperaturenumberControls the randomness of the model’s output. A higher number makes responses more creative; lower ones make them more deterministic.\\n\\u200bmax_tokensnumberLimits the total number of tokens in the response, effectively controlling how long the output can be.\\n\\u200btimeoutnumberThe maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request.\\n\\u200bmax_retriesnumberThe maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.\\nUsing init_chat_model, pass these parameters as inline **kwargs:\\nInitialize using model parametersCopymodel = init_chat_model(\\n    \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\\n    # Kwargs passed to the model:\\n    temperature=0.7,\\n    timeout=30,\\n    max_tokens=1000,\\n)\\n\\nEach chat model integration may have additional params used to control provider-specific functionality.For example, ChatOpenAI has use_responses_api to dictate whether to use the OpenAI Responses or Completions API.To find all the parameters supported by a given chat model, head to the chat model integrations page.\\n\\n\\u200bInvocation\\nA chat model must be invoked to generate an output. There are three primary invocation methods, each suited to different use cases.\\n\\u200bInvoke\\nThe most straightforward way to call a model is to use invoke() with a single message or a list of messages.\\nSingle messageCopyresponse = model.invoke(\"Why do parrots have colorful feathers?\")\\nprint(response)\\n\\nA list of messages can be provided to a chat model to represent conversation history. Each message has a role that models use to indicate who sent the message in the conversation.\\nSee the messages guide for more detail on roles, types, and content.\\nDictionary formatCopyconversation = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Translate: I love programming.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"J\\'adore la programmation.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Translate: I love building applications.\"}\\n]\\n\\nresponse = model.invoke(conversation)\\nprint(response)  # AIMessage(\"J\\'adore créer des applications.\")\\n\\nMessage objectsCopyfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage\\n\\nconversation = [\\n    SystemMessage(\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),\\n    HumanMessage(\"Translate: I love programming.\"),\\n    AIMessage(\"J\\'adore la programmation.\"),\\n    HumanMessage(\"Translate: I love building applications.\")\\n]\\n\\nresponse = model.invoke(conversation)\\nprint(response)  # AIMessage(\"J\\'adore créer des applications.\")\\n\\nIf the return type of your invocation is a string, ensure that you are using a chat model as opposed to a LLM. Legacy, text-completion LLMs return strings directly. LangChain chat models are prefixed with “Chat”, e.g., ChatOpenAI(/oss/integrations/chat/openai).\\n\\u200bStream\\nMost models can stream their output content while it is being generated. By displaying output progressively, streaming significantly improves user experience, particularly for longer responses.\\nCalling stream() returns an iterator that yields output chunks as they are produced. You can use a loop to process each chunk in real-time:\\nBasic text streamingStream tool calls, reasoning, and other contentCopyfor chunk in model.stream(\"Why do parrots have colorful feathers?\"):\\n    print(chunk.text, end=\"|\", flush=True)\\n\\nAs opposed to invoke(), which returns a single AIMessage after the model has finished generating its full response, stream() returns multiple AIMessageChunk objects, each containing a portion of the output text. Importantly, each chunk in a stream is designed to be gathered into a full message via summation:\\nConstruct an AIMessageCopyfull = None  # None | AIMessageChunk\\nfor chunk in model.stream(\"What color is the sky?\"):\\n    full = chunk if full is None else full + chunk\\n    print(full.text)\\n\\n# The\\n# The sky\\n# The sky is\\n# The sky is typically\\n# The sky is typically blue\\n# ...\\n\\nprint(full.content_blocks)\\n# [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"The sky is typically blue...\"}]\\n\\nThe resulting message can be treated the same as a message that was generated with invoke() – for example, it can be aggregated into a message history and passed back to the model as conversational context.\\nStreaming only works if all steps in the program know how to process a stream of chunks. For instance, an application that isn’t streaming-capable would be one that needs to store the entire output in memory before it can be processed.\\nAdvanced streaming topicsStreaming eventsLangChain chat models can also stream semantic events using astream_events().This simplifies filtering based on event types and other metadata, and will aggregate the full message in the background. See below for an example.Copyasync for event in model.astream_events(\"Hello\"):\\n\\n    if event[\"event\"] == \"on_chat_model_start\":\\n        print(f\"Input: {event[\\'data\\'][\\'input\\']}\")\\n\\n    elif event[\"event\"] == \"on_chat_model_stream\":\\n        print(f\"Token: {event[\\'data\\'][\\'chunk\\'].text}\")\\n\\n    elif event[\"event\"] == \"on_chat_model_end\":\\n        print(f\"Full message: {event[\\'data\\'][\\'output\\'].text}\")\\n\\n    else:\\n        pass\\nCopyInput: Hello\\nToken: Hi\\nToken:  there\\nToken: !\\nToken:  How\\nToken:  can\\nToken:  I\\n...\\nFull message: Hi there! How can I help today?\\nSee the astream_events() reference for event types and other details.\"Auto-streaming\" chat modelsLangChain simplifies streaming from chat models by automatically enabling streaming mode in certain cases, even when you’re not explicitly calling the streaming methods. This is particularly useful when you use the non-streaming invoke method but still want to stream the entire application, including intermediate results from the chat model.In LangGraph agents, for example, you can call model.invoke() within nodes, but LangChain will automatically delegate to streaming if running in a streaming mode.\\u200bHow it worksWhen you invoke() a chat model, LangChain will automatically switch to an internal streaming mode if it detects that you are trying to stream the overall application. The result of the invocation will be the same as far as the code that was using invoke is concerned; however, while the chat model is being streamed, LangChain will take care of invoking on_llm_new_token events in LangChain’s callback system.Callback events allow LangGraph stream() and astream_events() to surface the chat model’s output in real-time.\\n\\u200bBatch\\nBatching a collection of independent requests to a model can significantly improve performance and reduce costs, as the processing can be done in parallel:\\nBatchCopyresponses = model.batch([\\n    \"Why do parrots have colorful feathers?\",\\n    \"How do airplanes fly?\",\\n    \"What is quantum computing?\"\\n])\\nfor response in responses:\\n    print(response)\\n\\nThis section describes a chat model method batch(), which parallelizes model calls client-side.It is distinct from batch APIs supported by inference providers, such as OpenAI or Anthropic.\\nBy default, batch() will only return the final output for the entire batch. If you want to receive the output for each individual input as it finishes generating, you can stream results with batch_as_completed():\\nYield batch responses upon completionCopyfor response in model.batch_as_completed([\\n    \"Why do parrots have colorful feathers?\",\\n    \"How do airplanes fly?\",\\n    \"What is quantum computing?\"\\n]):\\n    print(response)\\n\\nWhen using batch_as_completed(), results may arrive out of order. Each includes the input index for matching to reconstruct the original order as needed.\\nWhen processing a large number of inputs using batch() or batch_as_completed(), you may want to control the maximum number of parallel calls. This can be done by setting the max_concurrency attribute in the RunnableConfig dictionary.Batch with max concurrencyCopymodel.batch(\\n    list_of_inputs,\\n    config={\\n        \\'max_concurrency\\': 5,  # Limit to 5 parallel calls\\n    }\\n)\\nSee the RunnableConfig reference for a full list of supported attributes.\\nFor more details on batching, see the reference.\\n\\n\\u200bTool calling\\nModels can request to call tools that perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, searching the web, or running code. Tools are pairings of:\\n\\nA schema, including the name of the tool, a description, and/or argument definitions (often a JSON schema)\\nA function or coroutine to execute.\\n\\nYou may hear the term “function calling”. We use this interchangeably with “tool calling”.\\nHere’s the basic tool calling flow between a user and a model:\\n\\nTo make tools that you have defined available for use by a model, you must bind them using bind_tools. In subsequent invocations, the model can choose to call any of the bound tools as needed.\\nSome model providers offer built-in tools that can be enabled via model or invocation parameters (e.g. ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic). Check the respective provider reference for details.\\nSee the tools guide for details and other options for creating tools.\\nBinding user toolsCopyfrom langchain.tools import tool\\n\\n@tool\\ndef get_weather(location: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Get the weather at a location.\"\"\"\\n    return f\"It\\'s sunny in {location}.\"\\n\\n\\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])  \\n\\nresponse = model_with_tools.invoke(\"What\\'s the weather like in Boston?\")\\nfor tool_call in response.tool_calls:\\n    # View tool calls made by the model\\n    print(f\"Tool: {tool_call[\\'name\\']}\")\\n    print(f\"Args: {tool_call[\\'args\\']}\")\\n\\nWhen binding user-defined tools, the model’s response includes a request to execute a tool. When using a model separately from an agent, it is up to you to execute the requested tool and return the result back to the model for use in subsequent reasoning. When using an agent, the agent loop will handle the tool execution loop for you.\\nBelow, we show some common ways you can use tool calling.\\nTool execution loopWhen a model returns tool calls, you need to execute the tools and pass the results back to the model. This creates a conversation loop where the model can use tool results to generate its final response. LangChain includes agent abstractions that handle this orchestration for you.Here’s a simple example of how to do this:Tool execution loopCopy# Bind (potentially multiple) tools to the model\\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])\\n\\n# Step 1: Model generates tool calls\\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What\\'s the weather in Boston?\"}]\\nai_msg = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)\\nmessages.append(ai_msg)\\n\\n# Step 2: Execute tools and collect results\\nfor tool_call in ai_msg.tool_calls:\\n    # Execute the tool with the generated arguments\\n    tool_result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)\\n    messages.append(tool_result)\\n\\n# Step 3: Pass results back to model for final response\\nfinal_response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)\\nprint(final_response.text)\\n# \"The current weather in Boston is 72°F and sunny.\"\\nEach ToolMessage returned by the tool includes a tool_call_id that matches the original tool call, helping the model correlate results with requests.Forcing tool callsBy default, the model has the freedom to choose which bound tool to use based on the user’s input. However, you might want to force choosing a tool, ensuring the model uses either a particular tool or any tool from a given list:Force use of any toolForce use of specific toolsCopymodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool_1], tool_choice=\"any\")\\nParallel tool callsMany models support calling multiple tools in parallel when appropriate. This allows the model to gather information from different sources simultaneously.Parallel tool callsCopymodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])\\n\\nresponse = model_with_tools.invoke(\\n    \"What\\'s the weather in Boston and Tokyo?\"\\n)\\n\\n\\n# The model may generate multiple tool calls\\nprint(response.tool_calls)\\n# [\\n#   {\\'name\\': \\'get_weather\\', \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'Boston\\'}, \\'id\\': \\'call_1\\'},\\n#   {\\'name\\': \\'get_weather\\', \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'Tokyo\\'}, \\'id\\': \\'call_2\\'},\\n# ]\\n\\n\\n# Execute all tools (can be done in parallel with async)\\nresults = []\\nfor tool_call in response.tool_calls:\\n    if tool_call[\\'name\\'] == \\'get_weather\\':\\n        result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)\\n    ...\\n    results.append(result)\\nThe model intelligently determines when parallel execution is appropriate based on the independence of the requested operations.Most models supporting tool calling enable parallel tool calls by default. Some (including OpenAI and Anthropic) allow you to disable this feature. To do this, set parallel_tool_calls=False:Copymodel.bind_tools([get_weather], parallel_tool_calls=False)\\nStreaming tool callsWhen streaming responses, tool calls are progressively built through ToolCallChunk. This allows you to see tool calls as they’re being generated rather than waiting for the complete response.Streaming tool callsCopyfor chunk in model_with_tools.stream(\\n    \"What\\'s the weather in Boston and Tokyo?\"\\n):\\n    # Tool call chunks arrive progressively\\n    for tool_chunk in chunk.tool_call_chunks:\\n        if name := tool_chunk.get(\"name\"):\\n            print(f\"Tool: {name}\")\\n        if id_ := tool_chunk.get(\"id\"):\\n            print(f\"ID: {id_}\")\\n        if args := tool_chunk.get(\"args\"):\\n            print(f\"Args: {args}\")\\n\\n# Output:\\n# Tool: get_weather\\n# ID: call_SvMlU1TVIZugrFLckFE2ceRE\\n# Args: {\"lo\\n# Args: catio\\n# Args: n\": \"B\\n# Args: osto\\n# Args: n\"}\\n# Tool: get_weather\\n# ID: call_QMZdy6qInx13oWKE7KhuhOLR\\n# Args: {\"lo\\n# Args: catio\\n# Args: n\": \"T\\n# Args: okyo\\n# Args: \"}\\nYou can accumulate chunks to build complete tool calls:Accumulate tool callsCopygathered = None\\nfor chunk in model_with_tools.stream(\"What\\'s the weather in Boston?\"):\\n    gathered = chunk if gathered is None else gathered + chunk\\n    print(gathered.tool_calls)\\n\\n\\n\\u200bStructured output\\nModels can be requested to provide their response in a format matching a given schema. This is useful for ensuring the output can be easily parsed and used in subsequent processing. LangChain supports multiple schema types and methods for enforcing structured output.\\n Pydantic TypedDict JSON SchemaPydantic models provide the richest feature set with field validation, descriptions, and nested structures.Copyfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\nclass Movie(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"A movie with details.\"\"\"\\n    title: str = Field(..., description=\"The title of the movie\")\\n    year: int = Field(..., description=\"The year the movie was released\")\\n    director: str = Field(..., description=\"The director of the movie\")\\n    rating: float = Field(..., description=\"The movie\\'s rating out of 10\")\\n\\nmodel_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie)\\nresponse = model_with_structure.invoke(\"Provide details about the movie Inception\")\\nprint(response)  # Movie(title=\"Inception\", year=2010, director=\"Christopher Nolan\", rating=8.8)\\nTypedDict provides a simpler alternative using Python’s built-in typing, ideal when you don’t need runtime validation.Copyfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated\\n\\nclass MovieDict(TypedDict):\\n    \"\"\"A movie with details.\"\"\"\\n    title: Annotated[str, ..., \"The title of the movie\"]\\n    year: Annotated[int, ..., \"The year the movie was released\"]\\n    director: Annotated[str, ..., \"The director of the movie\"]\\n    rating: Annotated[float, ..., \"The movie\\'s rating out of 10\"]\\n\\nmodel_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDict)\\nresponse = model_with_structure.invoke(\"Provide details about the movie Inception\")\\nprint(response)  # {\\'title\\': \\'Inception\\', \\'year\\': 2010, \\'director\\': \\'Christopher Nolan\\', \\'rating\\': 8.8}\\nFor maximum control or interoperability, you can provide a raw JSON Schema.Copyimport json\\n\\njson_schema = {\\n    \"title\": \"Movie\",\\n    \"description\": \"A movie with details\",\\n    \"type\": \"object\",\\n    \"properties\": {\\n        \"title\": {\\n            \"type\": \"string\",\\n            \"description\": \"The title of the movie\"\\n        },\\n        \"year\": {\\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\\n            \"description\": \"The year the movie was released\"\\n        },\\n        \"director\": {\\n            \"type\": \"string\",\\n            \"description\": \"The director of the movie\"\\n        },\\n        \"rating\": {\\n            \"type\": \"number\",\\n            \"description\": \"The movie\\'s rating out of 10\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \"required\": [\"title\", \"year\", \"director\", \"rating\"]\\n}\\n\\nmodel_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(\\n    json_schema,\\n    method=\"json_schema\",\\n)\\nresponse = model_with_structure.invoke(\"Provide details about the movie Inception\")\\nprint(response)  # {\\'title\\': \\'Inception\\', \\'year\\': 2010, ...}\\n\\nKey considerations for structured output:\\nMethod parameter: Some providers support different methods (\\'json_schema\\', \\'function_calling\\', \\'json_mode\\')\\n\\n\\'json_schema\\' typically refers to dedicated structured output features offered by a provider\\n\\'function_calling\\' derives structured output by forcing a tool call following the given schema\\n\\'json_mode\\' is a precursor to \\'json_schema\\' offered by some providers - it generates valid json, but the schema must be described in the prompt\\n\\n\\nInclude raw: Use include_raw=True to get both the parsed output and the raw AI message\\nValidation: Pydantic models provide automatic validation, while TypedDict and JSON Schema require manual validation\\n\\nExample: Message output alongside parsed structureIt can be useful to return the raw AIMessage object alongside the parsed representation to access response metadata such as token counts. To do this, set include_raw=True when calling with_structured_output:Copyfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\nclass Movie(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"A movie with details.\"\"\"\\n    title: str = Field(..., description=\"The title of the movie\")\\n    year: int = Field(..., description=\"The year the movie was released\")\\n    director: str = Field(..., description=\"The director of the movie\")\\n    rating: float = Field(..., description=\"The movie\\'s rating out of 10\")\\n\\nmodel_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie, include_raw=True)  \\nresponse = model_with_structure.invoke(\"Provide details about the movie Inception\")\\nresponse\\n# {\\n#     \"raw\": AIMessage(...),\\n#     \"parsed\": Movie(title=..., year=..., ...),\\n#     \"parsing_error\": None,\\n# }\\n\\nExample: Nested structuresSchemas can be nested:Pydantic BaseModelTypedDictCopyfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\nclass Actor(BaseModel):\\n    name: str\\n    role: str\\n\\nclass MovieDetails(BaseModel):\\n    title: str\\n    year: int\\n    cast: list[Actor]\\n    genres: list[str]\\n    budget: float | None = Field(None, description=\"Budget in millions USD\")\\n\\nmodel_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDetails)\\n\\n\\n\\u200bSupported models\\nLangChain supports all major model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and more. Each provider offers a variety of models with different capabilities. For a full list of supported models in LangChain, see the integrations page.\\n\\n\\u200bAdvanced topics\\n\\u200bModel profiles\\n This is a beta feature. The format of model profiles is subject to change. \\n Model profiles require langchain>=1.1. \\nLangChain chat models can expose a dictionary of supported features and capabilities through a .profile attribute:\\nCopymodel.profile\\n# {\\n#   \"max_input_tokens\": 400000,\\n#   \"image_inputs\": True,\\n#   \"reasoning_output\": True,\\n#   \"tool_calling\": True,\\n#   ...\\n# }\\n\\nRefer to the full set of fields in the API reference.\\nMuch of the model profile data is powered by the models.dev project, an open source initiative that provides model capability data. These data are augmented with additional fields for purposes of use with LangChain. These augmentations are kept aligned with the upstream project as it evolves.\\nModel profile data allow applications to work around model capabilities dynamically. For example:\\n\\nSummarization middleware can trigger summarization based on a model’s context window size.\\nStructured output strategies in create_agent can be inferred automatically (e.g., by checking support for native structured output features).\\nModel inputs can be gated based on supported modalities and maximum input tokens.\\n\\nUpdating or overwriting profile dataModel profile data can be changed if it is missing, stale, or incorrect.Option 1 (quick fix)You can instantiate a chat model with any valid profile:Copycustom_profile = {\\n    \"max_input_tokens\": 100_000,\\n    \"tool_calling\": True,\\n    \"structured_output\": True,\\n    # ...\\n}\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"...\", profile=custom_profile)\\nThe profile is also a regular dict and can be updated in place. If the model instance is shared, consider using model_copy to avoid mutating shared state.Copynew_profile = model.profile | {\"key\": \"value\"}\\nmodel.model_copy(update={\"profile\": new_profile})\\nOption 2 (fix data upstream)The primary source for the data is the models.dev project. This data is merged with additional fields and overrides in LangChain integration packages and are shipped with those packages.Model profile data can be updated through the following process:\\n(If needed) update the source data at models.dev through a pull request to its repository on GitHub.\\n(If needed) update additional fields and overrides in langchain_<package>/data/profile_augmentations.toml through a pull request to the LangChain integration package`.\\nUse the langchain-model-profiles CLI tool to pull the latest data from models.dev, merge in the augmentations and update the profile data:\\nCopypip install langchain-model-profiles\\nCopylangchain-profiles refresh --provider <provider> --data-dir <data_dir>\\nThis command:\\nDownloads the latest data for <provider> from models.dev\\nMerges augmentations from profile_augmentations.toml in <data_dir>\\nWrites merged profiles to profiles.py in <data_dir>\\nFor example: from libs/partners/anthropic in the LangChain monorepo:Copyuv run --with langchain-model-profiles --provider anthropic --data-dir langchain_anthropic/data\\n\\n\\u200bMultimodal\\nCertain models can process and return non-textual data such as images, audio, and video. You can pass non-textual data to a model by providing content blocks.\\nAll LangChain chat models with underlying multimodal capabilities support:\\nData in the cross-provider standard format (see our messages guide)\\nOpenAI chat completions format\\nAny format that is native to that specific provider (e.g., Anthropic models accept Anthropic native format)\\n\\nSee the multimodal section of the messages guide for details.\\nSome models can return multimodal data as part of their response. If invoked to do so, the resulting AIMessage will have content blocks with multimodal types.\\nMultimodal outputCopyresponse = model.invoke(\"Create a picture of a cat\")\\nprint(response.content_blocks)\\n# [\\n#     {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Here\\'s a picture of a cat\"},\\n#     {\"type\": \"image\", \"base64\": \"...\", \"mime_type\": \"image/jpeg\"},\\n# ]\\n\\nSee the integrations page for details on specific providers.\\n\\u200bReasoning\\nMany models are capable of performing multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. This involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\\nIf supported by the underlying model, you can surface this reasoning process to better understand how the model arrived at its final answer.\\nStream reasoning outputComplete reasoning outputCopyfor chunk in model.stream(\"Why do parrots have colorful feathers?\"):\\n    reasoning_steps = [r for r in chunk.content_blocks if r[\"type\"] == \"reasoning\"]\\n    print(reasoning_steps if reasoning_steps else chunk.text)\\n\\nDepending on the model, you can sometimes specify the level of effort it should put into reasoning. Similarly, you can request that the model turn off reasoning entirely. This may take the form of categorical “tiers” of reasoning (e.g., \\'low\\' or \\'high\\') or integer token budgets.\\nFor details, see the integrations page or reference for your respective chat model.\\n\\u200bLocal models\\nLangChain supports running models locally on your own hardware. This is useful for scenarios where either data privacy is critical, you want to invoke a custom model, or when you want to avoid the costs incurred when using a cloud-based model.\\nOllama is one of the easiest ways to run models locally. See the full list of local integrations on the integrations page.\\n\\u200bPrompt caching\\nMany providers offer prompt caching features to reduce latency and cost on repeat processing of the same tokens. These features can be implicit or explicit:\\n\\nImplicit prompt caching: providers will automatically pass on cost savings if a request hits a cache. Examples: OpenAI and Gemini.\\nExplicit caching: providers allow you to manually indicate cache points for greater control or to guarantee cost savings. Examples:\\n\\nChatOpenAI (via prompt_cache_key)\\nAnthropic’s AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware\\nGemini.\\nAWS Bedrock\\n\\n\\n\\nPrompt caching is often only engaged above a minimum input token threshold. See provider pages for details.\\nCache usage will be reflected in the usage metadata of the model response.\\n\\u200bServer-side tool use\\nSome providers support server-side tool-calling loops: models can interact with web search, code interpreters, and other tools and analyze the results in a single conversational turn.\\nIf a model invokes a tool server-side, the content of the response message will include content representing the invocation and result of the tool. Accessing the content blocks of the response will return the server-side tool calls and results in a provider-agnostic format:\\nInvoke with server-side tool useCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1-mini\")\\n\\ntool = {\"type\": \"web_search\"}\\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool])\\n\\nresponse = model_with_tools.invoke(\"What was a positive news story from today?\")\\nresponse.content_blocks\\n\\nResultCopy[\\n    {\\n        \"type\": \"server_tool_call\",\\n        \"name\": \"web_search\",\\n        \"args\": {\\n            \"query\": \"positive news stories today\",\\n            \"type\": \"search\"\\n        },\\n        \"id\": \"ws_abc123\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"type\": \"server_tool_result\",\\n        \"tool_call_id\": \"ws_abc123\",\\n        \"status\": \"success\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"type\": \"text\",\\n        \"text\": \"Here are some positive news stories from today...\",\\n        \"annotations\": [\\n            {\\n                \"end_index\": 410,\\n                \"start_index\": 337,\\n                \"title\": \"article title\",\\n                \"type\": \"citation\",\\n                \"url\": \"...\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n]\\nSee all 29 lines\\nThis represents a single conversational turn; there are no associated ToolMessage objects that need to be passed in as in client-side tool-calling.\\nSee the integration page for your given provider for available tools and usage details.\\n\\u200bRate limiting\\nMany chat model providers impose a limit on the number of invocations that can be made in a given time period. If you hit a rate limit, you will typically receive a rate limit error response from the provider, and will need to wait before making more requests.\\nTo help manage rate limits, chat model integrations accept a rate_limiter parameter that can be provided during initialization to control the rate at which requests are made.\\nInitialize and use a rate limiterLangChain in comes with (an optional) built-in InMemoryRateLimiter. This limiter is thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads in the same process.Define a rate limiterCopyfrom langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter\\n\\nrate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(\\n    requests_per_second=0.1,  # 1 request every 10s\\n    check_every_n_seconds=0.1,  # Check every 100ms whether allowed to make a request\\n    max_bucket_size=10,  # Controls the maximum burst size.\\n)\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\\n    model=\"gpt-5\",\\n    model_provider=\"openai\",\\n    rate_limiter=rate_limiter  \\n)\\nThe provided rate limiter can only limit the number of requests per unit time. It will not help if you need to also limit based on the size of the requests.\\n\\u200bBase URL or proxy\\nFor many chat model integrations, you can configure the base URL for API requests, which allows you to use model providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs or to use a proxy server.\\nBase URLMany model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., Together AI, vLLM). You can use init_chat_model with these providers by specifying the appropriate base_url parameter:Copymodel = init_chat_model(\\n    model=\"MODEL_NAME\",\\n    model_provider=\"openai\",\\n    base_url=\"BASE_URL\",\\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\\n)\\nWhen using direct chat model class instantiation, the parameter name may vary by provider. Check the respective reference for details.\\nProxy configurationFor deployments requiring HTTP proxies, some model integrations support proxy configuration:Copyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n\\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(\\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\\n    openai_proxy=\"http://proxy.example.com:8080\"\\n)\\nProxy support varies by integration. Check the specific model provider’s reference for proxy configuration options.\\n\\u200bLog probabilities\\nCertain models can be configured to return token-level log probabilities representing the likelihood of a given token by setting the logprobs parameter when initializing the model:\\nCopymodel = init_chat_model(\\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\\n    model_provider=\"openai\"\\n).bind(logprobs=True)\\n\\nresponse = model.invoke(\"Why do parrots talk?\")\\nprint(response.response_metadata[\"logprobs\"])\\n\\n\\u200bToken usage\\nA number of model providers return token usage information as part of the invocation response. When available, this information will be included on the AIMessage objects produced by the corresponding model. For more details, see the messages guide.\\nSome provider APIs, notably OpenAI and Azure OpenAI chat completions, require users opt-in to receiving token usage data in streaming contexts. See the streaming usage metadata section of the integration guide for details.\\nYou can track aggregate token counts across models in an application using either a callback or context manager, as shown below:\\n Callback handler Context managerCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.callbacks import UsageMetadataCallbackHandler\\n\\nmodel_1 = init_chat_model(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\\nmodel_2 = init_chat_model(model=\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\")\\n\\ncallback = UsageMetadataCallbackHandler()\\nresult_1 = model_1.invoke(\"Hello\", config={\"callbacks\": [callback]})\\nresult_2 = model_2.invoke(\"Hello\", config={\"callbacks\": [callback]})\\ncallback.usage_metadata\\nCopy{\\n    \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\': {\\n        \\'input_tokens\\': 8,\\n        \\'output_tokens\\': 10,\\n        \\'total_tokens\\': 18,\\n        \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0},\\n        \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}\\n    },\\n    \\'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\\': {\\n        \\'input_tokens\\': 8,\\n        \\'output_tokens\\': 21,\\n        \\'total_tokens\\': 29,\\n        \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'cache_read\\': 0, \\'cache_creation\\': 0}\\n    }\\n}\\nCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.callbacks import get_usage_metadata_callback\\n\\nmodel_1 = init_chat_model(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\\nmodel_2 = init_chat_model(model=\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\")\\n\\nwith get_usage_metadata_callback() as cb:\\n    model_1.invoke(\"Hello\")\\n    model_2.invoke(\"Hello\")\\n    print(cb.usage_metadata)\\nCopy{\\n    \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\': {\\n        \\'input_tokens\\': 8,\\n        \\'output_tokens\\': 10,\\n        \\'total_tokens\\': 18,\\n        \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0},\\n        \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}\\n    },\\n    \\'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\\': {\\n        \\'input_tokens\\': 8,\\n        \\'output_tokens\\': 21,\\n        \\'total_tokens\\': 29,\\n        \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'cache_read\\': 0, \\'cache_creation\\': 0}\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\u200bInvocation config\\nWhen invoking a model, you can pass additional configuration through the config parameter using a RunnableConfig dictionary. This provides run-time control over execution behavior, callbacks, and metadata tracking.\\nCommon configuration options include:\\nInvocation with configCopyresponse = model.invoke(\\n    \"Tell me a joke\",\\n    config={\\n        \"run_name\": \"joke_generation\",      # Custom name for this run\\n        \"tags\": [\"humor\", \"demo\"],          # Tags for categorization\\n        \"metadata\": {\"user_id\": \"123\"},     # Custom metadata\\n        \"callbacks\": [my_callback_handler], # Callback handlers\\n    }\\n)\\n\\nThese configuration values are particularly useful when:\\n\\nDebugging with LangSmith tracing\\nImplementing custom logging or monitoring\\nControlling resource usage in production\\nTracking invocations across complex pipelines\\n\\nKey configuration attributes\\u200brun_namestringIdentifies this specific invocation in logs and traces.

If you don’t specify a model value, then \\'model\\' and \\'model_provider\\' will be configurable by default.\\nCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nconfigurable_model = init_chat_model(temperature=0)\\n\\nconfigurable_model.invoke(\\n    \"what\\'s your name\",\\n    config={\"configurable\": {\"model\": \"gpt-5-nano\"}},  # Run with GPT-5-Nano\\n)\\nconfigurable_model.invoke(\\n    \"what\\'s your name\",\\n    config={\"configurable\": {\"model\": \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"}},  # Run with Claude\\n)\\n\\nConfigurable model with default valuesWe can create a configurable model with default model values, specify which parameters are configurable, and add prefixes to configurable params:Copyfirst_model = init_chat_model(\\n        model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\\n        temperature=0,\\n        configurable_fields=(\"model\", \"model_provider\", \"temperature\", \"max_tokens\"),\\n        config_prefix=\"first\",  # Useful when you have a chain with multiple models\\n)\\n\\nfirst_model.invoke(\"what\\'s your name\")\\nCopyfirst_model.invoke(\\n    \"what\\'s your name\",\\n    config={\\n        \"configurable\": {\\n            \"first_model\": \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\\n            \"first_temperature\": 0.5,\\n            \"first_max_tokens\": 100,\\n        }\\n    },\\n)\\nSee the init_chat_model reference for more details on configurable_fields and config_prefix.\\nUsing a configurable model declarativelyWe can call declarative operations like bind_tools, with_structured_output, with_configurable, etc. on a configurable model and chain a configurable model in the same way that we would a regularly instantiated chat model object.Copyfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\n\\nclass GetWeather(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"Get the current weather in a given location\"\"\"\\n\\n        location: str = Field(..., description=\"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetPopulation(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"Get the current population in a given location\"\"\"\\n\\n        location: str = Field(..., description=\"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\")\\n\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(temperature=0)\\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools([GetWeather, GetPopulation])\\n\\nmodel_with_tools.invoke(\\n    \"what\\'s bigger in 2024 LA or NYC\", config={\"configurable\": {\"model\": \"gpt-4.1-mini\"}}\\n).tool_calls\\nCopy[\\n    {\\n        \\'name\\': \\'GetPopulation\\',\\n        \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'Los Angeles, CA\\'},\\n        \\'id\\': \\'call_Ga9m8FAArIyEjItHmztPYA22\\',\\n        \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \\'name\\': \\'GetPopulation\\',\\n        \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'New York, NY\\'},\\n        \\'id\\': \\'call_jh2dEvBaAHRaw5JUDthOs7rt\\',\\n        \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'\\n    }\\n]\\nCopymodel_with_tools.invoke(\\n    \"what\\'s bigger in 2024 LA or NYC\",\\n    config={\"configurable\": {\"model\": \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"}},\\n).tool_calls\\nCopy[\\n    {\\n        \\'name\\': \\'GetPopulation\\',\\n        \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'Los Angeles, CA\\'},\\n        \\'id\\': \\'toolu_01JMufPf4F4t2zLj7miFeqXp\\',\\n        \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \\'name\\': \\'GetPopulation\\',\\n        \\'args\\': {\\'location\\': \\'New York City, NY\\'},\\n        \\'id\\': \\'toolu_01RQBHcE8kEEbYTuuS8WqY1u\\',\\n        \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'\\n    }\\n]\\n\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoAgentsPreviousMessagesNext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')]"

LangChain chat models are prefixed with “Chat”, e.g., ChatOpenAI(/oss/integrations/chat/openai).\\n\\u200bStream\\nMost models can stream their output content while it is being generated. By displaying output progressively, streaming significantly improves user experience, particularly for longer responses.\\nCalling stream() returns an iterator that yields output chunks as they are produced.

For instance, an application that isn’t streaming-capable would be one that needs to store the entire output in memory before it can be processed.\\nAdvanced streaming topicsStreaming eventsLangChain chat models can also stream semantic events using astream_events().This simplifies filtering based on event types and other metadata, and will aggregate the full message in the background.
