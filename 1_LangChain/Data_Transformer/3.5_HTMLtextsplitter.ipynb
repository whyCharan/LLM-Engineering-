It established itself as a distinct subfield of philosophy in\\nthe 1960s (Peters 1973a; Doyle 1973; Kominsky 1993), and its growth\\nsince the 1980s has been dramatic (Hirst & White 1998; Curren\\n2003, 2023a; Siegel 2009; Bailey et al. 2010; Phillips 2014; Smith\\n2015).  \\nOverviews of philosophy of education have adopted a variety of\\napproaches. One approach has been to present it as a field of\\ncompeting philosophical orientations or philosophies of education (N.\\nHenry 1942, 1955; Passmore 1980: 3–7). A second approach has\\nbeen to group works in philosophy of education according to the\\nrelated subfields of philosophy from which they draw resources (Soltis\\n1981). A third approach has been topical, using different aspects of\\neducation as the organizing basis for the field (Peters 1973a).\\nHybrids of these approaches and historical overviews have also\\nappeared (e.g., Blake et al. 2003; Siegel 2009).  \\nNo overview using any of these approaches can proceed without some\\nconception of the object of study, any more than philosophy of science\\nor philosophy of law can be defined and surveyed without a working\\nconception of what science or law is. Philosophical efforts to\\ndemarcate science, law, and education—to clarify their natures\\nby distinguishing them from other human endeavors—are a\\nfoundational aspect of the enterprise. As human endeavors, all three\\nhave natures that may be defined in part by specific practices and in\\npart by purposes, aims, or aspirations. They are all highly\\ninstitutionalized, diverse in the forms they take, and shape the ways\\nwe live. Important questions arise concerning the relationships\\nbetween education, law, and science as institutions, as well as the\\nrelationships between education and other basic institutions: the\\nfamily, economy, and religion. The questions concerning these\\nrelationships are to some extent normative, to some extent empirical,\\nand to some extent matters of social ontology.  \\nPhilosophy of education is thus concerned not only with philosophical\\nquestions about education as such but with larger questions of\\neducation policy and the roles of educational institutions in\\nsocieties. This entry adopts a topical approach organized around the\\nnature of education and the kinds of normative questions that arise\\nconcerning education.  \\nEntry Contents Entry Contents  \\n1.

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Philosophy of Education', 'Header 2': '1. The Object of Inquiry and Most Basic Questions'}, page_content='The natural point of departure for philosophical investigations of\\neducation is a pre-theoretical identification of educational practices\\nand the assumptions and aspirations, aims, or purposes that guide\\nthem. Education may be broadly characterized as the promotion of\\ndesirable forms of learning and personal development through practices\\nthat would provisionally include:  \\nof study, exploration, experimentation,\\ncollaboration, play, and other forms of exertion of abilities through\\nwhich desirable forms of learning and development typically\\noccur;  \\nsupervision  \\nor ;  \\ninstruction  \\nteaching  \\n, which combines supervision of practice,\\ndiagnosis of limitations of performance, and targeted\\ninstruction;  \\ncoaching  \\nassociated with coaching, supervision, and\\nstructuring of learning environments and activities;  \\nhabituation  \\nassociated with all of these;  \\nevaluation  \\nand ;  \\nmentoring  \\ncounseling  \\nand (i.e., ) aspects of supervision, instruction, and\\ncoaching (cf. Hirst & Peters 1970: 19).  \\nmotivational  \\ndisciplinary  \\ncorrectional  \\nEducation involving any number of these practices may occur more or\\nless informally in diverse settings.  \\nThe institutionalization of education embeds such practices in\\npara-educational practices that have become highly professionalized,\\nnotably:  \\nmanagement of educational institutions;  \\neducational policy making;  \\ncurriculum development;  \\nproduction of knowledge, including the evidential basis for\\neducational policy making;  \\nstudent and community life practices (e.g., fairs, clubs,\\nsports);  \\noccupational certification, credentialing, and placement in\\ninternships and jobs.  \\nThere are many questions about these educational and para-educational\\npractices that are at least partly philosophical. As human practices\\nwith significance for the interests of everyone in the society, there\\nare obviously ethical questions at stake, including questions of\\njustice. A high-level typology of the kinds of ethical questions at\\nstake can be predicated on the fact that supervision or governance of\\nthe activities of learners is a pervasive aspect of education. If\\nthere are distinct normative aspects of governance, there will be\\ncorresponding normative aspects of education. These arguably (Curren\\n2007; cf. White 1995a: 216) pertain to the:  \\nof education;  \\naims  \\nof education or what is communicated through\\ninstitutional structure, norms, rules, and curricula;  \\ncontent  \\nof education (e.g., pedagogy,\\nevaluation, and classroom management);  \\nmanner and methods  \\ngrounds, limits, and distribution of educational ;  \\nauthority  \\neducational , with respect to adequacy,\\nequality, inclusion, and student well-being.  \\nresponsibilities  \\nThe five basic questions about the conduct of education are thus: What\\nare its aims? What should its content be? How, or in what manner,\\nshould it be carried out? How is educational authority to be assigned?\\nWhat responsibilities does educating entail?  \\nAnswers to these normative questions about education typically begin\\nin conceptions of the nature of education, but they often rest on\\nphilosophical, empirical, and hybrid claims about human development,\\nrationality, well-being, freedom, motivation, virtues, knowledge,\\nunderstanding, language, communication, cooperation, measurement,\\nexpertise, democracy, a just society, work, and other matters. The\\npursuit of normative questions about education thereby leads one to\\nfurther questions that are largely philosophical but spill over into\\npsychology, sociology, psychometrics, political science, economics,\\nand other disciplines. Philosophy of education thus stands at a\\ncomplex intersection of philosophical sub-fields and other\\ndisciplines. It can choose to keep concrete matters of educational\\npolicy and practice at arms-length, but the trend in recent years has\\nbeen toward actionable ethical analysis, sometimes referred to as\\n“non-ideal theorizing” about educational justice\\n(Brighouse, Ladd, et al. 2018; Levinson 2023b; Levinson & Fay\\n2016, 2019; Levinson & Theisen-Homer 2015; Levinson, Geron et al.\\n2024; Levinson, Reid et al. 2024; Schouten & Brighouse 2015; Swift\\n2008; Taylor & Kuntz 2021). It can similarly choose to sidestep\\nthe empirical questions, but it is no coincidence that another trend\\nin recent years has been toward scholarship that is more empirically\\ninformed, cross-disciplinary, and collaborative than in the past.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Philosophy of Education', 'Header 2': '2. The Nature and Aims of Education'}, page_content='There was a time, in the 1960s and 70s, when philosophers of education\\ndevoted much of their attention to analyzing the nature or concept of\\neducation. Richard S. Peters, the leading light in philosophy of\\neducation in the U.K. at the time, held that education is concerned\\nwith the transmission of worthwhile things and what distinguishes it\\nfrom, on the one hand, training and, on the other hand, mere growth is\\nthat education promotes the development of students’ minds and\\ntheir appreciation of what is valuable, through voluntary initiation\\ninto  \\nmodes of conduct and thought which have standards written into them by\\nreference to which it is possible to act, think, and feel with varying\\ndegrees of skill, relevance and taste. (Peters 1965 [2007: 65]; cf.\\nOakeshott 1971)  \\nWhat Peters envisioned was students being able to see, understand, and\\nappreciate the world in powerful ways through the conceptual,\\nanalytical, and constructive resources of arts and sciences. He also\\nenvisioned students becoming willing participants in the ongoing life\\nof the traditions of practice and inquiry into which they are\\ninitiated, carrying those traditions forward and revising the existing\\nstandards as reasons to do so come to light (cf. Scheffler 1973). They\\nshould become willing and capable participants in the\\n“conversation” of mankind, as Michael Oakeshott (1959) put\\nit. Conceiving of education in this way, Peters argued that it cannot\\nbe fully justified instrumentally through the further benefits to\\nindividuals or societies it might yield, but he acknowledged some\\ndoubt as to whether it could be fully justified non-instrumentally\\nthrough the inherent rewards of inquiry and cultural\\npursuits—“goods which are constitutive of a worth-while\\nlevel of life” (Peters 1973b: 247). Peters was grappling with\\nsomething like Aristotle’s conception of a liberal education\\n(Nussbaum 1997; Nightingale 2001) and the “Aristotelian\\nHypothesis” on which it rested—the hypothesis that the\\nmost admirable pursuits, which he took to be forms of theoretical or\\nscientific inquiry, are also the most truly pleasant or rewarding\\n(Reeve 2012). The most worthwhile life, or life most objectively and\\nsubjectively fulfilling for a human being or community, would be the\\ndefining or (alternatively) most ethically appropriate purpose of\\neducation.  \\nPeters’ collaborator, Paul Hirst, framed a related conception of as initiation into forms of knowledge\\n(Hirst 1965) but later retreated from this to a more expansive\\nconception of education as initiation into human practices (Hirst\\n1993). In framing the latter view, he relied on Alasdair\\nMacIntyre’s (1981) conception of a practice (i.e., “any\\ncoherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human\\nactivity” [1981: 175]) and goods internal to practices (i.e.,\\ngoods attainable only in achieving “standards of excellence\\nwhich are appropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of\\nactivity” [1981: 175]). This yielded a less elitist—though\\nstill problematic (Hager 2011)—view of the worthwhile lives for\\nwhich students might be prepared, as well as the idea that integrity\\nin teaching involves fidelity to the goods internal to practices into\\nwhich students are initiated (Strike 2003). However, the dominant\\nfocus of the ensuing discussion of education as initiation into\\npractices was the question of whether teaching itself is a practice\\ninvolving internal goods that warrant a granting of professional\\nautonomy for teachers because such goods can only be appreciated by\\nthose engaged in the practice (MacIntyre & Dunne 2002; Dunne 2003;\\nHiggins 2003; Hogan & Smith 2003). MacIntyre insisted that\\nteaching is not a practice, others mostly disagreed, but the lesson of\\nthe debate is arguably that MacIntyre’s way of distinguishing\\n“internal” and “external” goods obscured the\\nrelationships between the inherent goods or aims of\\neducation—goods or aims without which it would not be\\neducation—and the further goods or purposes that might be\\nachieved through education (Hager 2011). Surveying the economic and\\ncivic aims that are often attributed to educational systems, Peters\\n(1965) argued unpersuasively that all such talk of aims is confused,\\nmuch as many have characterized liberal education as simply\\n“learning for learning’s sake”—learning\\nmotivated by the intrinsic or non-instrumental value of knowing, or\\nthe intrinsic or non-instrumental value of activities of learning or\\ninquiry, or the intrinsic or non-instrumental value of cultural\\nachievements that students may come to appreciate. Yet, there is no\\nobvious reason why education could not involve inherent goods or aims\\nand also justifiably serve further student-centered aims, public aims,\\nor both.  \\nliberal education  \\nRelated debates about the nature of education and idea of an educated\\nperson have played out in other work on liberal education (e.g.,\\nNussbaum 1997, 2004, 2010) and a primarily German literature of , or self-realization and wisdom acquired through\\n“culture” or the sciences, arts, and philosophy (Wood\\n1998; P. Watson 2010; Bakhurst 2011; Stojanov 2018a, 2018c). Both of\\nthese literatures accept the multiplicity of goods, purposes, or aims\\nthat might be achieved through education, much as Aristotle did in\\nholding that the multi-faceted purpose of education is to equip the\\nmembers of a society to live as partners in a flourishing life—a\\npurpose served by cultivating intellectual virtues that are enacted in\\na flourishing life, virtues sufficient for collective wisdom in civic\\npartnership in living well, and dispositions and bonds of civic\\nfriendship (Curren 2023b). Martha Nussbaum distinguishes an older\\nconception of education that is liberal ( ;\\n“fitted for freedom”) from a newer one, the older being an\\nuncritical initiation of a small elite into the cultural traditions\\nprized by their parents and the newer being a cultivation of ability\\nto think for oneself that prepares rich and poor alike for collective\\nself-governance (Nussbaum 1997). The latter, Socratic, form of liberal\\nhigher education is under attack today in the few countries where it\\nexists, and Nussbaum’s defense of it embraces a multicultural\\npreparation for global citizenship to address the global problems we\\nall face (Nussbaum 1997, 2010; cf. Culp 2019; Kitcher 2021).  \\nBildung  \\nliberalis  \\nIf education is the promotion of desirable forms of learning and\\npersonal development through instructional and supervisory practices,\\nit could have non-instrumental formative aims and also be expected to\\nserve any number of instrumental individual (i.e., student-centered)\\nand collective (i.e., civic, social, or economic) aims. Numerous\\nquestions arise concerning the nature, justification, prioritizing,\\ncompatibility, and harmonizing of educational aims.'),\n",

The Nature and Aims of Education', 'Header 3': '2.1 Formative Aims', 'Header 4': '2.1.1 The Inherent Aim Approach'}, page_content='There are versions of the inherent aim approach that offer variations\\non Peters’ idea that it is through education that minds develop.\\nOne might argue that it is through education broadly conceived that\\nhuman beings are able to function in “the space of\\nreasons” (McDowell 1994 [1996]; Bakhurst 2011, 2020), be\\nappropriately moved by reasons (Siegel 1988, 2003, forthcoming), or\\nbelieve and act in light of reasons. One might argue that it is\\nthrough education that human beings become self-conscious persons able\\nto know what they think and are doing (Rödl 2020; Bakhurst 2023).\\nOr one might argue that it is through education that human beings\\ndevelop capabilities essential to having minds of their own and living\\nwith dignity (Nussbaum 2004, 2011). These arguments provide plausible\\ngrounds for regarding education as having an inherently humanizing\\ncharacter or aim. However, it is hard to say education could be justified on these grounds, if the ability to\\nfunction as a rational being, know what one is doing, and have a mind\\nof one’s own is incremental. One could defend the related claim\\nthat being educated inherently involves the acquisition of knowledge\\n(Hirst & Peters 1970: 19; Siegel 2008; Sockett 2012), but\\nidentifying knowledge as an inherent aim of education would not\\nresolve this “how much” question either.  \\nhow much  \\nThe growth of culture—of languages, arts, and\\nsciences—augments the space of reasons or domains of knowledge\\ninto which initiation, and with respect to which epistemic agency, are\\npossible. In expanding the kinds of ideas we can have and act on, it\\nalso broadens the scope of epistemic responsibility we must shoulder\\nin navigating complex conceptual, social, and built environments,\\nwhile deepening our epistemic and practical dependence on experts in\\nspecialized branches of knowledge that we will never have time to\\nmaster. The relationships between epistemic ,\\nepistemic , and epistemic are thus important to clarifying epistemic ideals that have been\\nregarded as inherent aims of education (Robertson forthcoming).  \\nautonomy  \\nresponsibility  \\ndependence  \\nPhilosophical conceptions of epistemic and practical autonomy and\\nresponsibility have been bound up historically with closely linked\\nconceptions of reason and judgment. As Aristotle was founding a\\nhandful of sciences modeled on geometry, he championed a general\\neducation that would enable a person to judge what is and is not\\nproperly expounded in nearly all subjects but would fall short of\\nconferring scientific knowledge of all subjects ( 639a1–6; Reeve 1998: 58). As Aristotelian sciences\\nwere being discarded in the seventeenth century, René Descartes\\nheld similarly that universal wisdom is the proper aim of education,\\nbut he defended as a common possession of\\nhuman beings, guide for the conduct of life, and the very form of\\nreasoning essential to science (see his , , parts I and II, , and Dedicatory Letter\\nto the ). Descartes and John Locke\\nboth presented the use of natural reason in examining the basis of\\nideas as a natural standard of epistemic diligence in taking\\nresponsibility for the beliefs on which one acts and making them\\none’s own, or in other words as sufficient for both epistemic\\nand practical autonomy and responsibility (Locke 1706: § 12). If\\nautonomy is having and exercising a capacity to take responsibility\\nfor what one thinks, values, and does, natural reason was considered\\nnot only such a capacity but a way to what is true,\\ngood, and prudent. These early modern views are widely seen as going\\nastray by radically underestimating the extent of our epistemic\\ndependence on the collective epistemic labor of others. No one could\\npossibly have the time or intellectual capacity to adequately judge\\nfor themselves everything pertaining to their daily affairs or to know\\nall they may wish to know. Attaining epistemic autonomy through an\\nAristotelian education in the sciences has meanwhile been pushed ever\\nfarther out of reach by the proliferation of sciences and their roles\\nin shaping the complex world we navigate.  \\nParts of\\nAnimals  \\nnatural reason  \\nRules for the Direction of\\nthe Mind  \\nDiscourse on Method  \\nThe\\nSearch for Truth by Means of Natural Light  \\nPrinciples of Philosophy  \\nknow  \\nA common contemporary response to the realities of epistemic\\ndependence has been to argue that epistemic autonomy is compatible\\nwith extensive epistemic dependence (Adler 2002; Elgin 2002, 2013,\\n2022; Siegel 2005; Bakhurst 2014; D. Pritchard 2016b; Fricker 2022).\\nAccounts of what is sufficient for epistemic autonomy or agency\\ninclude good intellectual character (D. Pritchard 2023: 128), or a\\ncombination of epistemic virtue and taking responsibility for\\none’s beliefs in a way that involves fidelity to an epistemic\\ncounterpart of Kant’s categorical imperative (Elgin 2013).\\nFidelity to this “epistemic imperative” would involve\\nbelieving only what one could accept on the basis of reasons that can\\nbe justified to other members of an epistemic community. A second\\nresponse has been to abandon epistemic self-reliance as an educational\\naim (Hand 2006), and a third has been to shift the focus from autonomy\\nto responsibility (Robertson forthcoming), understanding epistemic\\nresponsibility as exertion of “controlling intelligence”\\n(Coady 1992: 248) that displays the motivation and skills\\ncharacteristic of intellectual virtue. Taking epistemic responsibility\\nin this sense would involve thinking for oneself that is\\nintelligent in the sense of being well informed and thoughtful about\\nthe trustworthiness of epistemic methods, sources, reasoning, and\\nevidence. It would involve epistemic agency or setting and adhering to\\nself-imposed rules for determining the basis on which one can endorse\\nbeliefs as one’s own. If autonomy is in this way a product of\\ntaking responsibility, then epistemic agency or responsibility might\\nbe seen as the primary educational end.  \\nsome'),\n",

Functioning as a rational being, knowing what one is doing,\\nand having a mind of one’s own all pertain to agency, and as\\nmuch to practical rationality as to epistemic rationality. Recognizing\\nthis, one might discern a non-instrumental basis for identifying the\\npromotion of autonomous rational agency (both practical and epistemic)\\nas a fundamental aim of education, the argument being that\\neducators’ duty of respect for students as rational beings\\nentails an obligation to cultivate their rationality or ability to be\\nappropriately moved by reasons. An epistemic variant of this argument\\nhas focused on students’ development as critical thinkers\\n(Scheffler 1973; Siegel 1988; 1997: 24–25, 73–87; 2016:\\n108–109), and a practical variant of it has focused on competent\\nself-determination (Locke 1690: § 69).  \\nIf there is a threshold of adequacy in such non-instrumentally\\njustified formative education, it might be conceptualized as the\\neducational prerequisites for competent self-determination, assigning\\nprimacy to practical rationality and a supporting role to epistemic\\nrationality. What bodies of knowledge or understanding would be\\nessential to reaching this threshold is unclear. From a curricular\\nstandpoint, the question is whether fulfilling the fundamental\\nformative aim of rational empowerment, or competent\\nself-determination, requires the kind of initiation into forms of\\nknowledge that Peters envisioned. How much ability to understand the\\nworld in the manner of a biologist, historian, anthropologist,\\ngeographer, economist, psychologist, epidemiologist, or climatologist\\ncan be defended as foundational to competent self-determination or\\nbeing competent to manage one’s affairs in an immensely complex\\nworld? How much understanding of these and other fields would be\\nenough to facilitate epistemic responsibility in determining what\\nsources to trust for guidance on relevant features of the contexts in\\nwhich one must make decisions?'),\n",

The Nature and Aims of Education', 'Header 3': '2.1 Formative Aims', 'Header 4': '2.1.3 The Intrinsic Goods Approach'}, page_content='The intrinsic goods approach is evident in recent work in philosophy\\nof education stimulated by the virtue epistemology and virtue ethics\\nmovements and related developments in intellectual and moral character\\neducation. It identifies intellectual virtues, moral virtues,\\nepistemic goods, and fulfillments of potential that partially or fully\\nconstitute human flourishing as intrinsically good, and it defends\\nthese as aims of education on the grounds that they are intrinsically\\nvaluable.  \\nvirtue theorists distinguish virtue from virtue . Virtue\\nreliabilism regards intellectual virtues as valuable because they are\\nreliable sources of truth (e.g., Sosa 1991), which is to say\\ninstrumentally valuable. Virtue responsibilism conceives of\\nintellectual virtues as analogous to moral virtues, and similar to\\nthem in having intrinsic value and involving love or valuing of\\nepistemic goods, such as truth, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom\\n(Zagzebski 1996; Roberts & Wood 2007; Baehr 2011). Responsibilist\\nintellectual virtue theorists who regard intellectual virtues and\\ngoods as intrinsically valuable can, and sometimes do, identify\\nvirtuous intellectual character, specific intellectual virtues (such\\nas open-mindedness, intellectual courage, and inquisitiveness), and\\nepistemic goods (such as truth, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom)\\nas intrinsic goods that should be pursued as non-instrumental aims of\\neducation.  \\nIntellectual  \\nreliabilism  \\nresponsibilism  \\nIn practice, there has been considerable debate about the relative\\nmerits of knowledge (Hirst 1965; Goldman 1999; Adler 2003; Bakhurst\\n2023), understanding (Elgin 1999, 2007, 2023; D. Pritchard 2013,\\n2016a), critical thinking (Ennis 1962; Scheffler 1973; McPeck 1981;\\nLipman 2003; Siegel 1988, 1997, 2003, 2017), and intellectual virtue\\n(Baehr 2011, 2016, 2021; Battaly 2006, 2016, 2023; D. Pritchard 2013,\\n2023) as the primary aim (or primary epistemic aim) of education\\n(Bakhurst 2023; Robertson 2009b; L. Watson 2016). These may all be\\nseen as intrinsic goods and as deeply interrelated educational aims,\\nbut also as aims that can pull apart and be justified in a variety of\\nways. Knowledge may be foundational to understanding (Bakhurst 2023)\\nbut not confer understanding (Zagzebski 2001; Kvanvig 2003; Elgin\\n2007, 2023). Understanding may be possible without knowledge (Elgin\\n1999, 2017), and students may be able to acquire understanding in some\\ndomains of knowledge many years before they could understand the\\ncomplexities of evidence in those domains well enough to have\\nknowledge (Elgin 1999). Knowledge may also be foundational to thinking\\ncritically about the matters addressed in a domain of knowledge\\n(Peters 1965; McPeck 1981; Siegel 1988), but knowledge without\\nintellectual virtues (D. Pritchard 2023) or broader skills of critical\\nthinking and a “critical spirit” (Siegel 1988, 1997) would\\nnot suffice for epistemic rational agency.  \\nvirtue theorists take a similar path to a\\nnon-instrumental justification of good moral character as an important\\naim of education. From a broadly Aristotelian perspective, genuine\\nmoral virtues and a comprehensively morally virtuous state of\\ncharacter are intrinsically good attributes—complex cognitive,\\nperceptual, motivational, emotional, and behavioral dispositions that\\ninvolve proper valuing of persons and are coordinated by practical\\nwisdom (Sherman 1989; Carr & Steutel 1999; Moss 2011;\\nKristjánsson 2015). From this perspective, morally good\\ncharacter is hard to tease apart from intellectually and civically\\ngood character, and the nature of practical wisdom and relationships\\nbetween moral, intellectual, and civic virtues play important roles in\\nclarifying the educational aims at stake.  \\nMoral  \\nThe nature of practical wisdom has been an object of disagreement\\nreflecting different readings of Aristotle’s pronouncements\\nabout in ( ) Book VI, and ethics as a science\\n( ) or foundational component of political\\nscience ( ) in Book I. Some readings have accepted the idea, promoted by\\nthe virtue ethics movement, that Aristotle sees no role for knowledge\\nof universal moral truths in virtuous decision-making (Nussbaum 1986;\\nDunne & Pendlebury 2003), while other readings deny this (Jaeger\\n1957; Lloyd 1968; Westphal 2012; D. Henry & Nielsen 2015; Curren\\n& Park 2024). Aristotle describes as\\n“concerned not only with universals but with particulars, which\\nbecome familiar from experience” ( VI.8\\n1142a13–15), implying roles for both perception and universal\\nmoral truths in wise decision-making. If moral virtue is an important\\naim of education, and practical wisdom is an essential aspect of\\ngenuine moral virtue, then moral knowledge and moral perceptiveness\\n(i.e., discernment of morally relevant “particulars” or\\naspects of situations) would be sub-aims. This is consistent with\\nAristotle’s presentation of the itself as a path from facts ( ) that are starting\\npoints of ethical inquiry to ethical or\\nscience.  \\nphronêsis  \\nNicomachean Ethics  \\nNE  \\nepistêmê  \\nhê politikê epistêmê  \\nNE  \\nphronêsis  \\nNE  \\nNicomachean Ethics  \\nto hoti  \\nepistêmê  \\nA further notable example of the intrinsic goods approach arises from\\nthe neo-Aristotelian claim that possession of virtues is partially\\nconstitutive of human flourishing. Regarding virtues and flourishing\\nas intrinsic goods provides the basis for non-instrumental\\njustifications of not only intellectual character education (D.\\nPritchard 2023: 130) and moral character education\\n(Kristjánsson 2015: 8), but also well-being education (Morris\\n2015). It brings us back to Peters’ conception of education as\\ninitiation into worthwhile pursuits that make for a worthwhile life.\\nInitiation into activities of a flourishing life might qualify as an\\ninherent aim of education on Peters’ conception of education,\\nbut identifying flourishing as an intrinsic good defends it not as a\\ndefining or inherent aim of education but as an ethically appropriate\\none.  \\nA notable feature of non-instrumentally justified formative education\\nis that it seems to escape the dilemma, aptly framed by Jean-Jacques\\nRousseau (1762 [1979: 37–42]), of how it can be equally the individual student and the society. By\\ncontrast, instrumental justifications of educational aims may appeal\\nto the good of the student, the good of the society, or both. The\\nprospect of tensions between what is good for the individual student\\nand what is good for the society has long been an animating theme in\\nphilosophy of education.  \\nfor  \\nfor'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Philosophy of Education', 'Header 2': '2. The Nature and Aims of Education', 'Header 3': '2.2 Student-Centered Aims'}, page_content='Several student-centered educational aims have been addressed in\\nrecent years. Classifying them as “student-centered”\\nidentifies them as pertaining to the individual well-being of\\nstudents. The term “well-being” signifies that a life is\\ngoing well for the person living it (Parfit 1984; Raz 2004; Tiberius\\n2008), and since there are several aspects to how a life goes, there\\nare bound to be a variety of possible aims of education for which\\nstudent-centered justifications can be offered.  \\nIn this vein, Harry Brighouse, Helen Ladd, Susanna Loeb, and Adam\\nSwift identify  \\nsix capacities that everyone should have in modern societies and which\\n… will tend to support the flourishing of both the educated\\nperson and others: the capacities for economic productivity, personal\\nautonomy, democratic competence, healthy personal relationships,\\ntreating others as equals, and personal fulfillment. (Brighouse, Ladd,\\net al. 2018: 22)  \\nThe significance of most of these capacities for the student’s\\nown well-being is easy to discern. Autonomy is understood as\\nindividuals’  \\nability to make and act on well-informed and well-thought-out\\njudgments about both how to live and what to do in their everyday\\nlives. (2018: 23)  \\nDemocratic competence equips students to protect their interests\\nthrough democratic processes (cf., Levinson 2012; Allen & Kidd\\n2023). Capacity for personal fulfillment equips individuals with\\ninterests and competence that enable them “to find joy and\\nfulfillment” in life experiences and activities (Brighouse, Ladd\\net al. 2018: 27). Brighouse, Ladd, Loeb, and Swift refer to these\\ncapacities as conducive to “the flourishing of both the educated\\nperson and others” (2018: 22). Other defenses of flourishing as\\nan overarching aim of education are similarly sensitive to the\\nrelationship between individual and collective well-being. The\\nrelationship is perhaps most widely perceived with respect to\\ncapacities for economic productivity and mutual benefit in market\\ntransactions, but the identification of flourishing as an overarching\\naim of education requires a reconciliation of the individual’s\\nand others’ opportunities to live well that is as broad as the\\neducation in question. This can show up in how the educational aim is\\ndefined (e.g., as equipping the members of a society to live as\\npartners in a flourishing life), in how flourishing itself is defined\\n(e.g., as a life of activity that is both admirable and personally\\nfulfilling), and in reliance on empirical claims about prerequisites\\nof human well-being (e.g., that enactment of social virtues is a\\nnecessary condition for happiness).  \\nBrighouse, Ladd, et al. write that educators aim to instill knowledge,\\nskills, dispositions, and attitudes (2018: 19), implicitly identifying\\nthese formative “educational goods” as inherent aims of\\neducation, while holding that “what matters, ultimately, is the\\ncreation and distribution of opportunities for people to\\nflourish” (2018: 21). It is appropriate to focus on for flourishing, they say, “because the\\nmost that educational goods can do is equip people with what they need\\nfor their lives to go well” (2018: 21). In saying this, they use\\nthe term “flourishing” to refer—as the term\\n“well-being” does—to a life going well, all things\\nconsidered, in both its objective and subjective dimensions. This is\\ntypical of recent defenses of flourishing as an overarching aim of\\neducation, in assuming that there is an open-ended variety of ways in\\nwhich people can live well and that the task of educators is to\\npromote learning that facilitates students’ pursuit of lives\\nthat are personally meaningful and satisfying for them while also\\ncontributing to others being able to live well (Brighouse 2006, 2008;\\nCurren 2013; de Ruyter 2004, 2007, 2015; de Ruyter & Wolbert 2020;\\nde Ruyter, Oades, et al. 2022; Kristjánsson 2020; Schouten\\n2023; White 1995b, 2011). Flourishing is typically understood to\\ninvolve fulfillment of potential that exhibits admirable qualities and\\nis personally meaningful, satisfying, and enjoyable (Darwall 1999; de\\nRuyter, Oades, et al. 2022; Kraut 2007). Helping students fulfill\\ntheir potential in such ways is a common aspiration of teachers, and\\nthe simplest justification for regarding flourishing as an overarching\\naim of education is that having this aim in view is indistinguishable\\nfrom educating students with a view to their well-being or life-long\\ninterest in living well. Curren, Boniwell et al. (2024) have argued\\nthat shaping students’ development without this in view is\\nunethical.  \\nopportunities  \\nCritics argue that the open-endedness of ways in which it is possible\\nto live well implies that aiming to equip students for flourishing\\nlives is either devoid of actionable content (Carr 2021) or\\nillegitimately favors a predetermined conception of living well\\n(Siegel 2015, forthcoming). Another objection is that only things that\\nare teachable can be aims of education, flourishing is not teachable,\\nso flourishing is not the kind of thing that can be an aim of\\neducation (Hand forthcoming). A response to this is that educating\\nwith a view to students being able to live better lives than they\\ncould otherwise live is still educating—it is still promoting\\ndesirable forms of learning and personal development through familiar\\nkinds of educational practices. The fundamental distinguishing feature\\nof education for flourishing is its conception of what makes forms of\\nlearning and personal development .  \\ndesirable  \\nAlternative conceptualizations of educational goods and capacities\\nfavorable to living well have been proposed, such as Nussbaum and\\nAmartya Sen’s Capability Approach (Nussbaum 2004, 2011;\\nUnterhalter 2003, 2016; Walker & Unterhalter 2007; Hart &\\nBrando 2018; Terzi et al. 2023), and debates have played out regarding\\nstudent-centered defenses of specific educational aims, such as\\nautonomy and labor market success. Student-centered defenses of\\neducation for autonomy have rested on affirmations of children’s\\nrights, the instrumental value of autonomy in enabling individuals to\\nchoose lives that can be good ones for them, and its constitutive role\\nin living well (J. Feinberg 1980). By contrast, John Rawls (1993: 199)\\nand others have argued that state mandated autonomy education is\\ninconsistent with civic respect for members of religious sects that\\nperceive autonomy as alien to their ways of life. One response to this\\nconcern has been to argue that autonomy must be acknowledged as a\\npolitical good and “providing citizens the means and freedoms to\\nexercise it” is a requirement of justice even in Rawls’s\\n“political” form of liberalism (Levinson 1999: 22).\\nAnother response concedes that mandating education in robust autonomy\\n(i.e., engagement in independent reflection and judgment) would not be\\nlegitimate from this political liberal standpoint, but argues that\\neducational of autonomy (Brighouse 2000) or\\neducation in a minimal form of autonomy (Reich 2002) would\\nlegitimately secure children’s instrumental interest in being\\nable to critically evaluate their prospects of having a good life if\\nthey accept the conception of a good life with which they have grown\\nup. A more recent response defends universal education in robust\\nautonomy by arguing that it is a precondition for all citizens being\\nable to obtain the fair value of access to the goods that liberal\\nprinciples of justice distribute in the interest of fairness in the\\nopportunities diverse citizens have to live lives that are good for\\nthem (Schouten 2018: 1091).  \\nfacilitation  \\nWhile no one disputes the claim that a capacity for economic\\nproductivity is helpful to living well, there has been much debate\\nregarding specific forms that the aim of labor market success has\\ntaken. Regarding secondary schools, the goal of “college for\\nall” has inspired debate, in part because the functional aim is\\noften to maximize college admission at any cost. Neglect of civic\\neducation, student well-being, and viable alternatives to college have\\nbeen identified as important costs to consider (Ben-Porath 2013;\\nLamboy & Lu 2017). A related debate is underway regarding a recent\\nemphasis on colleges and universities having a special role to play in\\nproviding individuals with socio-economic mobility. Here too, there\\nare costs of upward mobility to students who seek it and to their home\\ncommunities, especially for college students who experience cultural\\nalienation and tensions between their support roles within their\\nfamilies and pursuing their individual success (Voigt 2017; Laden\\n2022, 2023, 2024; Morton 2019, 2021b, 2023; Curren 2023c). There are\\nalso civic costs entailed by institutions pitting people against each\\nother in high-stakes competitions (Hussain 2020) mediated by academic\\ncredentials (Sandel 2020, 2022; Brighouse 2022). It is also arguably\\ncostly to universities themselves to be deflected from the educational\\ngoods of “knowledge, personal transformation, and value\\nacquisition” that are “inherent to [their] mission”\\n(Morton 2023: 289; cf. Martin 2022; Higgins 2024).'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Philosophy of Education', 'Header 2': '2. The Nature and Aims of Education', 'Header 3': '2.3 Social, Civic, and Economic Aims'}, page_content='Schools have been expected to play a variety of civic, social, and\\neconomic aims, from nation building (i.e., civic unification\\npredicated on a common national identity) and promoting national\\nsecurity, to eliminating poverty, disease, and crime, to facilitating\\neconomic growth and competitiveness. The dominance of economic aims in\\nglobal educational policy in recent decades has been a focus of\\ncritique, as much for what it has eclipsed as for its false promises\\nand damaging consequences. Debates about the compatibility of these\\neconomic aims with other educational aims, the soundness of their\\nrationales, and the damaging consequences of their modes of pursuit\\nare substantially empirical. A founding supposition of the educational\\npursuit of economic growth and competitiveness has been that high\\nrates of economic growth can be sustained for all countries through\\nhigh levels of achievement in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,\\nand Math) education (Hanushek & Woessmann 2010), but there is\\nevidence suggesting it is impossible to sustain high economic growth\\nin developed countries with populations that are already highly\\neducated (Tamir 2023). The use of high-stakes and international\\ncomparative exams in Reading, Math, and Science in an attempt to\\ncompel higher achievement in the interest of economic aims has been\\ncriticized as very costly in its consequences for quality of\\ninstruction and learning, student well-being, teacher demoralization,\\nand (consequently) teacher shortages (Deci 2009; Ryan & Brown\\n2005; Pelletier & Sharp 2009; Santoro 2018; Tamir 2023). While\\nsome of the tension between the aim of sustaining economic growth and\\nother educational aims might be seen as avoidable, a case has been\\nmade for regarding the former as fundamentally at odds with the\\nexistentially important aim of preparing students to engage in global\\ncivic cooperation to address climate destabilization, future\\npandemics, and other problems that require globally coordinated\\nresponses (Kitcher 2021, 2023).  \\nTurning from economic growth and national competitiveness to the role\\nof knowledge and expertise in public policy and the professions, some\\nrelated themes in philosophy of education are the nature and\\nacquisition of expertise and the role of educational institutions in\\nthe production and dissemination of public knowledge (i.e., knowledge\\nthat is publicly enabled and intended to serve the public interest).\\nSocieties cannot meaningfully address the problems they face without\\ninvesting in the creation and dissemination of public knowledge and\\nthe cultivation and certification of related forms of expertise. The\\nbenefits of the resulting can be\\nwidely shared if the society is democratic, if certification of\\nexpertise is based on the possession of expertise and related\\nprofessional integrity, and if members of the public are able to\\ndiscern who the relevant experts are and trust them appropriately\\n(Kitcher 2011a, b). Educational institutions play key roles in systems\\nof public knowledge, and the trust vested in them is foundational to\\nthe enterprise (Laden 2024). Civic polarization, the politicization of\\nknowledge, and declining trust in universities and other institutions\\nof public knowledge has rekindled philosophers’ interest in the\\naims of science education: If widespread support for science-based\\npolicy is important to the common good, should the aim of basic\\nscience education for all students be a kind of scientific literacy\\nthat enables them to identify trustworthy scientific experts or\\ninstitutions? Would such literacy involve having scientific knowledge,\\nhaving historical and philosophical knowledge of how science works (M.\\nMatthews 2000, 2015), being able to distinguish trustworthy from\\nuntrustworthy sources of scientific claims, or something else? Anjan\\nChakravartty has argued that basic science literacy should focus on\\nthe astonishing instrumental success of science as a basis for public\\nacceptance of science-based policy (Chakravartty 2023). By contrast,\\nMatt Ferkany points to evidence that knowledge of the basic mechanism\\nof anthropogenic global warming makes a difference to climate policy\\nstances across the polarized political spectrum, concluding that it is\\ntoo early to abandon the aim of teaching for basic knowledge of\\nscience (Ferkany 2023: 359, 362).  \\nepistemic division of labor  \\nSomewhat related to this debate about public acceptance of scientific\\nexpertise as a basis of public policy are long-running debates about\\nthe nature of expertise as an aim of education, especially\\nprofessional education, and the general problem of how consumers of\\nexpertise can discern the possession of expertise that they themselves\\nlack. There are cognitive accounts of the nature of expertise that\\nidentify its key aspect as knowledge, intellectual insight, or\\nunderstanding of how things within some domain work (Fricker 2006;\\nGoldman 2018; J. Watson 2021). There are skill-based accounts that\\nregard expertise as a kind of embodied practical mastery that can be\\nfluid and intuitive in its operation (Dreyfus & Dreyfus 1986).\\nThere are also hybrid accounts that combine knowledge and skill in one\\npackage (Addis & Winch 2019; Winch 2010a, b). The significance of\\nthese accounts for the education and recognition of expertise are\\ndebated, but it has been plausibly suggested that an important sub-aim\\nof education in professional expertise is to promote ethical\\nattributes and competence in communication that would enable experts\\nto establish and retain the trust of non-experts (Quast 2018; Kotzee\\n2023).  \\nThere have meanwhile been long-running debates about the aims of civic\\neducation, focused on democratic deliberation, civic motivation,\\nidentity, and advancing justice. John Dewey’s conception of\\ndemocratic education has had enduring influence (Dewey 1916; Riley\\n& Welchman 2003; Kitcher 2021, 2023), and his concerns about\\nfascism and respect for norms of public reason (what he called\\n“social intelligence”) are as relevant today as when he\\nwrote them (Dewey 1939). He conceived of democratic societies as\\nengaging in mutually respectful collective inquiry and\\nproblem-solving, guided by shared respect for scientific methods and\\nthe plurality of concerns of their members (Dewey 1927). He thought it\\nwas in a democracy of this kind that human beings can\\n“grow” or flourish, so democratic education would not\\nsimply aim to prepare students for democratic citizenship, it would\\naccomplish this by initiating them into the kind of civic life through\\nwhich they can grow or flourish both as adults and as children.  \\nThe recent era of work on the civic aims of education began with Amy\\nGutmann’s (1987), William\\nGalston’s (1991), and John Rawls’s (1993). It has included notable works by Eamonn Callan\\n(1997, 2000, 2006), Stephen Macedo (1995, 2003), Rob Reich (2002), and\\nVictoria Costa (2011), as well as volumes edited by Robert Fullinwider\\n(1996a), Macedo and Yael Tamir (2002), and Kevin McDonough and Walter\\nFeinberg (2003). Gutmann argued that democracies have a right to\\npreserve themselves through education that cultivates virtues of\\ndemocratic citizenship—virtues that bring together moral\\ncharacter and reasoning, enhancing students’ individual freedom\\nwhile making them willing and able to reason together critically and\\nrespectfully about matters of public concern (Gutmann 1987, 1995,\\n2002, 2003). Education that enables everyone to participate\\n“effectively” in democratic deliberation (1987:\\n136–137) is both an investment in the survival of democracy and\\na requirement of justice associated with a right to politically\\nmeaningful speech, according to Gutmann.  \\nDemocratic Education  \\nLiberal Purposes: Goods, Virtues, and Diversity in\\nthe Liberal State  \\nPolitical\\nLiberalism  \\nNorms of public reason play a similarly important role in\\nRawls’s and (2001), which address political\\nlegitimacy, justice, and the norms of political discourse in\\nmulticultural democracies. To be capable of social cooperation,\\ncitizens are regarded as having two “moral powers”, a\\n“capacity for a sense of justice” and “the capacity\\nto have, to revise, and to rationally pursue a conception of the\\ngood”—i.e., a conception of “what is of value in\\nhuman life”, normally grounded in comprehensive\\n“religious, philosophical, or moral doctrines” (Rawls\\n2001: 18–19). Citizens who subscribe to different comprehensive\\nconceptions of the good (CCGs) but are willing to accept fair terms of\\ncooperation would have reasons to endorse constitutional principles of\\njustice and associated premises of that provide\\na “shared basis for citizens to justify to one another their\\npolitical judgments” (2001: 27, 89–94). “Citizens\\nmust be able… to present to one another publicly acceptable\\nreasons for their political views in cases raising fundamental\\npolitical questions” (2001: 91), and they must accept what Rawls\\ncalls the as conditions on “the use\\nof public reason in directing the legitimate exercise of political\\npower” (Rawls 1993: 54; 2001: 35–36). Publicly acceptable\\nreasons pertaining to the factual basis of political judgments come to\\nrest in scientific methods, evidence, and consensus, to the extent\\nthese are relevant, so the education that prepares citizens to engage\\nin democratic deliberation must be in part an education in deference\\nto scientific methods and expertise, so far as public matters are\\nconcerned (cf. Gutmann & Thompson 1996: 15). The burdens of\\njudgment are factors that give rise to differences of judgment among\\nreasonable people and acknowledging them when faced with beliefs and\\njudgments different from one’s own is fundamental to respectful\\nengagement with others in the enterprise of public reason.  \\nPolitical Liberalism  \\nJustice as\\nFairness: A Restatement  \\npublic reason  \\nburdens of judgment  \\nCallan and others have argued that Rawls glosses over the extent to\\nwhich this requires civic education that brings diverse children\\ntogether, so they can learn to accept the burdens of judgment and\\nrespectfully engage each other in the practice of public reason\\n(Callan 1997). Rawls’s theory of justice would thus imply that\\nchildren can be required to participate in civic education, in\\nsettings that nurture respectful dialogue between students of diverse\\nbackgrounds, in the interest of securing the social basis for a\\nlegitimate scheme of democratic cooperation. A foundational aspect of\\nsuch a scheme of cooperation is the civic, democratic, or relational\\nequality entailed by Rawls’s underlying conception of free and\\nequal citizenship. So there are evidently two closely related aims of\\neducation at stake: cultivating the understanding, capabilities, and\\nvirtues foundational to a political order regulated by public reason\\nand enabling citizens to function as civic equals (Anderson 2007,\\n2010a, 2010b; Satz 2007; Curren 2023c).  \\nVisions of deliberative democracy rest on the idea that democracy\\nmediated by citizens giving each other reasons that reasonable people\\ncould accept is more attractive than democracy mediated by brute\\nmajority power. Critics have argued that compliance with norms of\\nreason would constrain progress in confronting injustice masked by a\\nsemblance of good faith reasoning. When opponents willfully violate\\nthe cooperative norms of democratic deliberation and do so in pursuit\\nof ends that could not be publicly justified, reasoning may offer no\\nremedy. A response to this criticism has been to hold that students\\nmust be prepared for both ideal contexts, in which compliance with\\nfair terms of cooperation (hence norms of public reason) is universal,\\nand non-ideal civic contexts, in which such compliance is not\\nuniversal (Robertson 2000, 2009a). Students must learn how progress\\ntoward more perfect justice has been achieved in non-ideal\\ncircumstances, how they themselves can contribute to such justice, and\\nhow to enact mutually respectful civic relations whenever possible. In\\nconditions of racial domination (Blum 1996, 2012, 2024; Thompson 2023;\\nWheeler-Bell 2023) and domination of less powerful peoples and states\\nin international relations (Gutmann 2002), civic and moral education\\nwould thus rightly enlighten students about the conditions in which\\nthey live and how progress is possible, while promoting informed\\ncritical reflection about what is just and ethical.  \\nEquipping and disposing students to promote justice is thus a further\\nand distinct civic aim of education that is defended by philosophers\\nof education (Bialystok 2023). Variations on this theme include\\npromotion of global justice (Culp 2019; Curren & Dorn 2018;\\nKitcher 2021) and sustainability-related intergenerational justice\\n(Bell 2004; Curren & Metzger 2017; Zwarthoed 2015). While\\neducation for sustainable development has been promoted as conducive\\nto both global and intergenerational justice, it has also been\\ncriticized as failing to respect liberty rights and other democratic\\nvalues (Ferkany & Whyte 2013; Schinkel 2009; Schlottmann 2008).\\nAnother noteworthy focus has been the contributions of universities to\\nthe unjust advantage of the most advantaged and what professors can\\nlegitimately do to educate students in a way that mitigates unjust\\nadvantage (Brighouse 2010; Morton 2021a; Schouten 2022).  \\nCivic aims of education concern not only students’ civic\\nunderstanding and capabilities (such as to function as civic equals\\nand participate in processes of public reason) but also attitudes,\\ndispositions, virtues, and sources of motivation that can sustain\\nconstructive civic engagement. Ideas about such motivation have\\nfocused on patriotism, identity, and civic friendship (or solidarity;\\nKitcher 2021, 2023). A common starting point has been the assumption\\nthat ideals of justice and democracy are either too abstract or\\n“thin” to motivate civic responsibility, or that enabling\\nstudents to develop a rational appreciation of the merits of these\\nideals will, for some other reason, rarely succeed in motivating them\\nto act in defense of those ideals (Galston 1991: 243–244).\\nInstilling a motivating commitment to these ideals is then taken to\\nrequire something “thicker”, such as providing\\ninspirational tales of mythologized national heroes or cultivating a\\nshared national identity. Discussions of civic motivation as an aim of\\neducation have consequently revolved around the propriety of teaching\\npatriotism (Archard 1999; Ben-Porath 2006; Blum 2007; Brighouse 2003;\\nCallan 1997, 2006; Fullinwider 1996b; Gutmann 2002; Hand 2011; R.\\nMiller 2007; Nussbaum 2012) and to a lesser extent civic friendship\\n(e.g., Allen 2004) and the “thick” social (e.g., racial)\\nidentities that citizens bring to their civic roles (Allen & Kidd\\n2023). Galston and Callan have defended mythologizing education in\\nnon-nationalistic forms of patriotism as facilitating commitment to\\nnorms of justice, while Sigal Ben-Porath has made a similar argument\\nfor the usefulness of patriotic education in enabling societies to\\nendure the hardships of war. Critics have countered that publicly\\nsponsored cultivation of sentiments of loyalty and partiality toward\\ncompatriots undermines the legitimacy of governments (Brighouse 1998,\\n2003; cf. Callan 2000), is inconsistent with equal basic moral respect\\nfor non-compatriots and requirements of global justice (Gutmann 2002;\\nR. Miller 2007) and ignores a variety of other ways in which actual\\npatriotism “all too often cuts against justice” (Brighouse\\n2003: 163). Habermas’s conception of constitutional patriotism,\\ninvolving ongoing scrutiny of a country’s constitutional\\ntradition in light of universal norms (Habermas 1992) has inspired\\nforms of “best traditions patriotism” (Blum 2007), and\\nbeen incorporated into a conception of virtuous patriotism as\\nethically appropriate valuing of a country’s inhabitants and\\nwhat is conducive to them living well together (Curren 2021, Curren\\n& Dorn 2018). These latter views deny the common assumption that\\nabstract civic and moral ideals are too “thin” to be\\nmotivationally potent and in doing so undercut the premise that just\\nsocieties require education that aims to cultivate patriotic\\nsentiments. They may, however, attach motivational significance to\\neducating diverse children together as equals, so they can form\\nintergroup friendships that facilitate broader intergroup trust and\\ncooperation.  \\nPhilosophical justifications of educational aims have obvious\\nsignificance for the content, manner, and methods of education, and it\\nis to these matters that we now turn. Questions of educational\\nauthority and educational responsibilities will follow, and these too\\nare relevant to curriculum, teaching, educational administration, and\\na host of related matters.'),\n",

The Content of Education', 'Header 3': '3.1 Curriculum, Aims, and Ability'}, page_content='Regarding aims, some of those discussed above imply sweeping, if not\\ncomprehensive, approaches to educational content. If autonomy is an\\nimportant aim of education and being autonomous is being able to form\\nand act on one’s own well-informed judgments about how to live\\none’s life, then the content of education should include an\\narray of subjects that enable students to understand aspects of the\\nworld that will matter to the kinds of decisions they will need to\\nmake. It should also expose them to diverse values and life goal\\norientations, and it should enable them to think critically and make\\ngood decisions. Meaningful encounters with diverse goods, conceptions\\nof the good, and kinds of lives will be greatly enhanced if they are\\nnot merely curricular but include learning from diverse school peers\\nand a school ethos that offers alternatives to the profit-seeking\\npopular culture that dominates students’ attention (Brighouse\\n2005).  \\nIf equipping students to live well or flourish is the primary aim of\\neducation, then education for autonomy might be combined with\\nopportunities to discover and develop competence in interests and\\npursuits that can contribute to a flourishing life. The content of\\neducation might in that case be determined less by a broadly autonomy\\nenhancing grounding in disciplinary knowledge and understanding, and\\nmore by diverse opportunities to engage in activities of learning that\\ncan enable students to experience the inherent rewards of fulfilling\\ntheir social, creative, and agentive potential in pursuit of things\\nthey care about (Noddings 1992). Knowledge, understanding, and\\nintellectual virtue outcomes might be just as robust as what a\\ndisciplines-first approach would yield, but more tailored to\\nstudents’ self-determined paths, while the development of\\ncompetence in decision-making or practical wisdom might be\\nstronger.  \\nIf education in democratic citizenship is prioritized, education for\\nautonomy might be supplemented with more opportunities to learn what\\nit is possible to learn from diverse fellow students through debate,\\ncollaborative problem-focused learning, and opportunities to form\\ncivically significant inter-group friendships. In a world of problems\\nthat can only be effectively addressed through global cooperation,\\neducation in democratic citizenship might also engage students in\\nglobally networked collaborative learning that is focused on global\\nproblems (Culp 2019; Curren & Dorn 2018; Kitcher 2021, 2023).  \\nMore specific educational aims could have more and less widely\\nsignificant implications for school curricula. Meaningful\\nsustainability education would require far-reaching changes in\\nexisting curricula, whether the aim is to facilitate a transition to a\\nsustainable human footprint or simply to enable students to understand\\nthe complexly interacting human, built, and natural systems that shape\\neveryday decisions and their collective impact.

By contrast, the\\naim of promoting sexual self-determination and health through sex\\neducation would have limited curricular implications.  \\nPhilosophical work on the respective merits of a common curriculum\\nversus differentiated curricula has been shaped by the aims at stake,\\nideas about differences in student ability and interests, and the\\nimportance attached to accommodating parents’ concerns that\\nschool content be consistent with their worldviews and values. In\\ndefense of democratic education, Dewey objected to tracking secondary\\nstudents from privileged backgrounds into a liberal arts curriculum\\nand others into a vocational curriculum, proposing a kind of hybrid of\\nthese for all students (Dewey 1916). Nussbaum has recently advanced\\nsomething similar in her role as an architect of the curriculum of the\\nAsian University for Women, which aims to educate women leaders for\\nAsia and the Middle East, by integrating a liberal arts education with\\nprofessional training and encouraging students to apply the analytical\\ntools they acquire to regional problems (Nussbaum 2004).

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Philosophy of Education', 'Header 2': '3. The Content of Education', 'Header 3': '3.2 Moral and Character Education'}, page_content='Moral and character education have been the subject of extensive\\nphilosophical and cross-disciplinary research in recent years. The\\ndistinction between and may be clearest in the tension between theories of\\nmoral development inspired by Kant and conceptions of character\\nformation inspired by Aristotle. The former focus on the principles\\nthat enter into moral judgments, ignoring Kant’s theory of\\nvirtue (Munzel 1999, 2012), while the latter focus on virtues,\\nignoring the role of universals in Aristotelian practical wisdom. The\\nresulting polarization is to some extent an artifact of the perceived\\nlegitimacy that virtue-focused education has derived from the virtue\\nethics movement’s ambition to provide an alternative to\\ndeontological and consequentialist orientations in normative ethical\\ntheory. Taking this at face value, one would expect moral education to\\nrevolve around making decisions on the basis of moral principles and\\ncharacter education to be focused on the formation of virtue through\\nhabituation and emulation of exemplars (Croce & Vaccarezza 2017;\\nKristjánsson 2015, 2017; Zagzebski 2013). They do, to some\\nextent, but the contrast is less simple than it appears.  \\nmoral education  \\ncharacter\\neducation  \\nOne complicating factor is that the Kant-inspired theories of moral\\ndevelopment, propounded by the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg and his\\nstudents, concern moral cognition and offer no account of moral\\nmotivation. Attempts to fill this motivational gap have turned to\\nsomething like Aristotelian habituation through immersion in a just\\nschool community (Power 1988; Power & Higgins-D’Alesandro\\n2008) and the idea that if people form identity-defining moral\\ncommitments they will be motivated to act in ways that are consistent\\nwith their “moral identity” or conception of themselves as\\nhaving specific moral commitments (Lapsley & Stey 2014). A\\nschool’s collective commitment to functioning in accordance with\\njust principles would be an explicit aspect of the content of\\neducation, and predicating membership in the school community on\\nsharing that commitment would promote students’ identification\\nof those just principles as their own. This would shrink the distance\\nbetween moral and character education, especially if character\\neducators acknowledged that there are unavoidably rule-like elements\\nin habituation and civic virtue.  \\nAs a theory of moral motivation, the “moral identity”\\nconstruct arguably fails, however. Being motivated to preserve a\\nmorally positive self-understanding can undermine, as well as promote,\\nmoral conduct (Krettenauer 2022), and from a philosophical perspective\\nit is too ego-involved to constitute genuinely moral motivation. An\\nalternative view is that genuinely moral motivation involves\\nresponsiveness to both the value of what is at stake and\\nconsiderations bearing on what is morally appropriate in the\\ncircumstances (S. Meyer 2016), and that educators can foster such\\nmotivation by modelling appropriate valuing and moral reasoning in\\nways that support students’ basic psychological needs for not\\nonly relatedness, as in early versions of the just school community\\nmodel, but also autonomy and competence (Curren & Ryan 2020). A\\nsomewhat related strand of recent philosophy of education concerns the\\npossibility of valuational progress or individuals coming to hold new\\nvalues in a way that is agentive or autonomous (Annas 2011; Callard\\n2017, 2018).  \\nA second complicating factor that shrinks the distance between moral\\nand character education is the role of practical wisdom, and thereby\\nmoral universals, in an Aristotelian conception of virtue. Key\\nquestions are how such wisdom can be fostered, and how reasoning that\\nis an outgrowth of habituation can be autonomous (Peters 1981; Sherman\\n1989; Annas 2011; Curren & Park 2024; cf. Copp 2016; Hand 2018, on\\nmoral indoctrination). “Intellectualist” forms of\\nneo-Aristotelian character education originating in the work of Nancy\\nSherman (1989) have significant implications for the content of\\ncharacter education because they regard habituation that nurtures the\\ndevelopment of genuine virtue as necessarily supervised in ways that\\nare cognitively rich and autonomy supportive (Ferkany & Creed\\n2014).  \\nOther philosophical orientations in the sphere of moral and character\\neducation include neo-Humean sentimentalist approaches (Noddings 2002;\\nSlote 2010), and Philosophy for Children and Community of Inquiry\\napproaches that were first introduced by Matthew Lipman (2003), Gareth\\nMatthews (1980, 1984, 2009), and Michael Pritchard (1985, 1996).  \\nCritics of moral character education have made a variety of arguments\\nbearing on its compatibility with justice-promoting civic education\\n(Boyd 2011; Suissa 2015; Sanderse 2019). When education in character\\nvirtue is presented as instrumentally helpful to addressing such\\nproblems as inequality, lack of social mobility, and unemployment\\n(Paterson et al. 2014), critics have insisted that moral character\\neducation is at best a distraction from, and at worst incompatible\\nwith, civic education that prepares young people to fight for\\njustice-enhancing structural reform. Inculcation of specific virtues,\\nsuch as civility, has also been seen as delegitimizing appropriate\\nresponses to injustice, and to that extent incompatible with education\\nfor vigorous pursuit of justice (Ward 2017). A response to this is\\nthat genuinely virtuous moral, intellectual, and civic attributes\\nwould necessarily be aspects of a harmoniously integrated state of\\ncharacter. Alleged moral or civic virtues that cannot be fully\\nintegrated would not qualify as genuine virtues. So, civility would\\nqualify as a virtue only if it is understood in such a way as to be\\ncompatible with appropriately vigorous (i.e., virtuous) response to\\ninjustice (Peterson 2019: 25–32).'),\n",

What is and is not properly regarded as\\ncontroversial in a way that makes teaching it\\n“directively” or as something true is itself a matter of\\nphilosophical controversy (Drerup 2023; Hand 2008, 2014; Hess &\\nMcAvoy 2015; Tillson 2017; Zimmerman & Robertson 2017).  \\nThere are a variety of reasons for thinking that only well-established\\ntruths should be taught or as true. Assumptions\\nand commitments that are foundational to rational inquiry, a\\nconstitutional rule of law, and rights-respecting democracy should\\nsimilarly be presented as such. Educators should thus exhibit\\nintellectual honesty and diligence in teaching students what they need\\nto know and should take care not to mislead them, yet it is also\\nwidely thought that education in rational (e.g., scientific) inquiry\\nand for democratic citizenship are facilitated by engaging students in\\ncollective inquiry, debate, and deliberation that would sometimes\\naddress controversial matters. What should count as controversial for\\nthis purpose is itself controversial, and the debate has featured a\\nnumber of proposed criteria (Drerup 2023; Hand 2008, 2014; Hess &\\nMcAvoy 2015; Tillson 2017; Zimmerman & Robertson 2017). From the\\nstandpoint of civic education, one might favor a criterion of that allows students to debate\\ncontroversies that have currency in political decision-making (Hess\\n& McAvoy 2015). However, one would then need to decide whether\\nempirical questions (e.g., about the causes and hazards of climate\\nchange) that are controversial in this political sense should be\\npresented as controversial in schools, or whether an that treats empirical claims as non-controversial if\\nthey are well-established within the most authoritative epistemic\\ncommunities should be determinative (Hand 2007, 2008, 2014; Tillson\\n2017; Zimmerman & Robertson 2017). Consensus among climatologists\\nwould permit directive teaching of well-established climate science\\nunder an epistemic criterion, and the individual and collective\\ninterests of students and humanity would evidently require it. One\\ncould also object that there are things that should be debated that\\nare not debated, and others that are debated but should not be debated\\nbecause they are matters of fundamental rights. A recent example of\\nthe latter (in the U.S.) is same-sex marriage, and a specific concern\\nregarding treating it as controversial in classrooms is the likelihood\\nof dignitary harm to students with same-sex parents (Drerup 2023; J.\\nMayo 2016). In determining what can be taught directively and should\\nnot be presented as controversial, recognizing roles for both\\nepistemic closure within relevant communities of experts and\\nfundamental principles of justice would align with education in\\nRawlsian norms of public reason (see Drerup 2023).  \\ndirectively  \\npolitical authenticity  \\nepistemic\\ncriterion  \\nShould the existence of racial injustice be taught as fact and as an\\naspect of promoting free and equal citizenship? Should it be debated\\nas an open question or ignored because there is no public consensus\\nthat it should be addressed in schools? Anti-racist education\\nqualifies as controversial (in the U.S.) under the test, but it is typically regarded in philosophy of\\neducation as an important aspect of moral education (Blum 1996, 2012,\\n2024; Thompson 2018, 2023; Wheeler-Bell 2019a, b, 2023). It would\\nchallenge negative interpersonal values (e.g., racial stereotyping and\\nantipathy), promote positive interpersonal values (e.g., positive\\ninterracial respect and appreciation), challenge negative systemic\\nvalues (e.g., systemic racial injustice in the criminal justice\\nsystem), and promote positive systematic values (e.g., interracial\\ncivic friendship and the achievement of free and equal citizenship)\\n(Blum 2024). In Quentin Wheeler-Bell’s words, it would  \\npolitical\\nauthenticity  \\nprovide students with the sociological and moral understanding\\nessential to autonomously navigating unjust institutions and working\\ncollectively to advance democratic equality and human flourishing.\\n(Wheeler-Bell 2023: 280)  \\nAnti-racist education with these components would not be unacceptably\\ncontroversial under a criterion for acceptable directive teaching\\nconsistent with Rawlsian norms of public reason, provided it is\\nempirically well-grounded, affirms free and equal citizenship and\\nrelated principles of justice, and fosters civic friendship, trust,\\nand cooperation. Predicating education for racial justice on a\\nspecific controversial theory of the nature of race might put the\\nlegitimacy of the enterprise in doubt, but philosophical work on\\nracial identity and anti-racist education has been more circumspect\\nthan popular discourse in this regard (see esp., Thompson 2018,\\n2023).  \\nEducation concerning anthropogenic climate change and other aspects of\\nsustainability also qualifies as controversial (in the U.S.) under the test, despite the overwhelming\\nconsensus of climatologists and sustainability science that human\\nactivities are destabilizing Earth’s climate and life-sustaining\\nsystems in ways that will be increasingly catastrophic. Education\\nconcerning these matters has seemed important enough to warrant a\\nUNESCO Decade of Education for Sustainable Development\\n(2005–2014), but there are disagreements about its content. A\\nphilosophically significant concern is whether the ethical content of\\nclimate and sustainability education is compatible with an appropriate\\nstandard of liberal neutrality (Ferkany & Whyte 2013; Schinkel\\n2009; Schlottmann 2008, 2012; Zwarthoed 2015). Sustainability has been\\nperceived by many environmental ethicists as requiring a\\ntransformative moral perspective on the value of nature, and the\\neducational promotion of such a perspective would evidently be\\ninconsistent with liberal neutrality. An alternative view is that no\\nsuch moral transformation is required; the ethical dimensions of\\nclimate and sustainability are applications of familiar principles of\\ncommon morality. Climate and sustainability education are defended as\\nfoundational to legitimate global cooperation in addressing the\\nproblems and to fulfilling children’s right to know what is\\nessential to living prudently and responsibly in the world they will\\nface. These rationales suggest a need for integrated curricula that\\npromote understanding of the ways planetary, economic, and social\\nsystems interact, critical thinking about well-being and life goal\\norientations, and education in collaborative problem solving and\\nglobal citizenship (Curren & Metzger 2017: 153–179; Kitcher\\n2021, 2023).  \\npolitical authenticity'),\n",

A\\nfundamental debate concerning methods of inquiry is whether\\nstudents’ mastery of these methods is essential to fulfilling\\nthe epistemic aims of education. Epistemic agency evidently requires\\nsome command of methods of inquiry, and philosophical interest in the\\nrole of these methods in education is at least as old as Plato’s\\nattention to the limitations of Socrates’ method of questioning\\n( ) in his dialogue The elenchus is a\\nmethod of refutation through which inconsistencies are exposed, and\\nthe dialogue also depicts a very different form of “Socratic\\nmethod” through which a boy is led to deduce a theorem of\\ngeometry. Aristotle structured the sciences that he subsequently\\nfounded as axiomatic systems modelled on geometry, and acquiring\\nknowledge of such a science would require a student to reason their\\nway up from the foundational axioms and definitions through chains of\\ntheorems and back. Experiencing instances of the natural kinds that\\nare the objects of the science would also be essential to grasping\\nwhat it is about, and Aristotle’s works on biology and politics\\nprovide models of direct instruction on scientific methods (esp.,\\nschemes of classification) and findings (e.g., generalizations about\\nthe causes of stability and instability of different kinds of\\nconstitutions). The need for such direct instruction was put in\\nquestion by Descartes’ identification of as the very form of reasoning essential to science, and\\nRousseau’s vision of learning through inquiry in was predicated on this very assumption of\\nidentity between natural and scientific reason. Rousseau envisioned\\nthe eponymous boy Émile rediscovering astronomy and physics\\nthrough his own observations, as if the methods of sciences were not\\ninventions and precise measurement, mathematical models, and invented\\nconcepts played no role (M. Matthews 2000, 2015). Initiation into the\\nestablished conceptual schemes, methods, and ideals of sciences and\\nother disciplines remains today a different conception of how to\\npromote active learning from pedagogies that\\ntake the relevant forms and norms of individual and collective\\nthinking to be natural or intuitive (Elgin 2011; Grandy 1998; Phillips\\n1995; M.

If one grants that learning to think\\ncritically about questions addressed by forms of disciplinary\\nknowledge is enhanced by mastering the concepts, modes of inquiry and\\nanalysis, and standards of evidence and rigor that have been developed\\nby these disciplines, then one may conclude that these elements of\\ndisciplines should be explained and modeled by teachers and mastered\\nby students through supervised practice.  \\nelenchus  \\nMeno.  \\nnatural reason  \\nÉmile  \\nconstructivist  \\nCritical thinking and intellectual virtues pedagogues have similarly\\nassumed that there are teachable attributes of critical thinkers or\\nintellectual virtues that transcend the various disciplines and are\\nwidely applicable.

Turning to\\nintellectual character education, Heather Battaly has helpfully\\nidentified the elements of a standard approach as well as some\\nlimitations. The standard elements are  \\n(1) formal instruction about the intellectual virtues; (2) exposure to\\nexemplars of virtue; (3) practice in actions that\\nexemplars would perform and in motivation and\\nemotions that exemplars would have; (4) practice in actions that exemplars would perform and in motivations and emotions they would have; (5) practice\\nin recognizing situations in which the virtue in question is relevant;\\nand (6) reflection on one’s development. (Battaly 2023: 138)  \\nidentifying  \\nidentifying  \\nperforming  \\nhaving  \\nBattaly argues that this standard approach must be supplemented with\\nameliorative strategies to address the intellectual vices that many\\nstudents may have, and that if tendencies to intellectual vices are\\nwidespread then ameliorative strategies won’t be enough.\\nAddressing systemic causes of intellectual vices, including common\\nfeatures of schools (Kidd 2019), would also be essential.  \\nRecognition of the obstacles to nurturing intellectual and civic\\nvirtues in an age of polarization has inspired related efforts to\\nconstructively address perceived threats to free speech and safety in\\nspeaking on college and university campuses (Ben-Porath 2017, 2023,\\n2024; Cudd 2019) and the role of trust in epistemic networks and the\\nwork of universities (Laden 2023, 2024). The significance of student\\nspeech and freedom from indoctrination have been concerns in the\\ncontext of schools as well (Ben-Porath & Webster 2023; Callan\\n2011, 2016; Callan & Arena 2009; Warnick 2009, 2013), especially\\nin connection with the value of debate and deliberation for civic\\nlearning (as discussed above).  \\nTeachers’ minute-by-minute orchestration of students’\\nlearning involves much more than teaching, of course. It may often be\\nfocused as much on students’ behavior as on academic learning,\\nand their responses to students’ failures to meet behavioral\\nexpectations can take many forms, from educational and problem-solving\\ninterventions to restorative practices and various forms of\\npunishment. While specific forms and aspects of surveillance (Warnick\\n2007), behavioral regimes (Ben-Porath 2013; Lamboy & Lu 2017), and\\npunishment (e.g., corporal punishment and racial disparities) in\\nschools have received some ethical scrutiny, it is only very recently\\nthat fundamental questions about the justification of punishment in\\nschools have received sustained attention: On what grounds, with what\\nprocedural safeguards, and for what kinds of failures might specific\\nforms of punishment of minor children in the custody of schools be\\ndispensed, consistent with the formative purposes of schools and the\\nlimitations of decisional competence on which the need for custody is\\npredicated (Lamboy, Taylor & Thompson 2020; Thompson & Tillson\\n2020, 2023)? Is a problem-solving approach that enlists students in\\nunderstanding why they fail to meet expectations ethically preferable\\nto punishment, on the grounds that it promotes self-regulation? Are\\nrestorative practices that qualify as punishment essential to\\nupholding the norms of a just school community when offenses cause\\nsignificant harm (Scribner & Warnick 2021)?'),\n",

They have also been shaped by a variety of philosophical\\npositions on the normative considerations that should determine\\nassignments of authority over various aspects of education. The\\nchallenges to public educational authority include efforts to obtain\\nexemptions from the normally required number of years of schooling (J.\\nFeinberg 1980), the exemption of religious institutions from legal\\nbarriers to discrimination on the basis of sex (Dwyer 1998; Galston\\n2003), homeschool movements that have fought regulation of education\\nprovided in homes and requirements for children to be educated in\\nschools (Dwyer & Peters 2019), parents’ and\\nlegislator’s efforts to prevent subjects from being taught in\\npublic schools (Bialystok & Andersen 2022; Laats & Siegel\\n2016; Pennock 2002), and parents’ assertions of a presumed right\\nto selectively opt their children out of required educational content\\n(Archard 2000; Bialystok 2018). The normative considerations adduced\\nin debating these challenges include the respective rights and\\ninterests of parents, children, and the public (Archard & Macleod\\n2002; Brighouse & Swift 2006b, 2014; Dwyer 1998, 2003; Dwyer &\\nPeters 2019; J. Feinberg 1980; Galston 2003; Gutmann 1987, 2003;\\nLevinson 1999; Macleod 1997; Reich 2009), the consequences of\\ndistributing educational authority in different ways (Brighouse &\\nSwift 2023), the right or responsibility of a constitutional democracy\\nto provide for the educational basis of its continuity across\\ngenerations (Gutmann 1987; Rawls 1971, 1993, 2001), applications of\\nprinciples of liberal justice to families (Clayton 2006), and\\ndifferent conceptions of the parent-child relationship (Brighouse\\n& Swift 2014).  \\nStrands of Ancient Greek and Enlightenment Liberal thought play\\nsignificant roles in recent debates concerning educational authority.\\nPlato and Aristotle proposed public monopolies on the provision of\\nschooling that would be compulsory for all citizen children. There was\\nno semblance of public education in their world apart from compulsory\\nenrollment in military training and service in Sparta and Crete, a\\ncontext that is most evident in Plato’s , where the\\npoint of having a system of public day schools is essentially to train\\nand enlist citizens in individual and collective self-governance in\\naccordance with reason—to “rule and be ruled as justice\\ndemands” (Plato 643e–644a). Plato took a\\nstep toward this in the opening lines of the , where\\nhe implicitly repudiates Socrates’ apparent view that education\\ncould safely remain in the hands of families if philosophers provided\\nhigher education in ethical inquiry. The implication is that only a\\nsociety that invests in early education that strengthens the rational\\nelement in human nature can achieve the form of civic life mediated by\\nreasoning together that Socrates envisioned (Curren 2000). Plato seems\\nto predicate public educational authority on the desirability of this\\nform of life.  \\nLaws  \\nLaws  \\nRepublic  \\nTurning to Enlightenment Liberal thought, Locke argued that parents\\nhave a fundamental duty to provide their children the care and\\neducation they need to become rational beings who can govern and\\nprovide for themselves. He held that parents’ educational\\nauthority derives from their educational duties and is thus limited\\nand contingent on ongoing fulfillment of those duties (Locke 1690:\\n§ 69). John Stuart Mill went farther than Locke in repudiating\\nparents’ claims to “absolute and exclusive control”\\nover their children’s education, insisting it is  \\nalmost a self-evident axiom that the State should require and compel\\nthe education, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is\\nborn its citizen. (Mill 1859 [1978: 104])  \\nWhat has been recently quoted far more often, however, is Mill’s\\nassertion in the next paragraph of that “A\\ngeneral State education is a mere contrivance for molding people to be\\nexactly like one another” (1859 [1978: 104–105]).\\nContemporary challenges to public educational authority quote this,\\nand defenders of it respond by arguing that individuality and\\ndiversity are compatible with public provision of education and a\\ndivision of educational authority.  \\nOn Liberty  \\nResponding directly to Mill, Gutmann argued that dividing educational\\nauthority between parents, citizens, and professional educators is\\nessential to fulfilling a democratic state’s commitment  \\nto provide its members with an education adequate to participating in\\ndemocratic politics, to choosing among (a limited range of) good\\nlives, and to sharing in the several subcommunities, such as families,\\nthat impart identity to the lives of its citizens. (Gutmann 1987:\\n42)  \\nDefending teachers’ professional authority as essential to their\\nrole in cultivating students’ capacity for critical deliberation\\n(1987: 82), she established a point of reference for ensuing\\ndiscussions of teachers’ authority and bureaucratic,\\nlegislative, and parental encroachment on their exercise of\\nprofessional judgment (see Levinson 2023a, Levinson & Fay 2016,\\n2019, on the inescapable role of teachers’ judgment in good\\nteaching). An alternative three-way division of educational authority\\nwas suggested by Rob Reich, who argued that, in addition to parents\\nand states, children themselves should have a share of authority over\\ntheir own education that is commensurate with their progress toward\\nautonomy or prudence in making decisions about their own lives (Reich\\n2009). Children have a strong interest in their own education, just as\\nparents and states both have legitimate interests in children’s\\neducation, and their respective interests might be well-served by\\nrecognizing each as having some authority. The line of argument here\\nis typical of recent debates in combining consequentialist\\nconsiderations with arguments from justice and rights, in this case an\\nadolescent’s emerging right of self-determination and the\\nabsence of any countervailing parental right to determine the life\\ncourse of a child.  \\nProponents of unregulated homeschooling typically hold that\\nparents’ custodial authority entails an exclusive and unlimited\\nright to control their children’s education (Dwyer & Peters\\n2019). Reich, Brighouse, Clayton, Dwyer, Levinson, and others deny\\nthat parents have any such right, while developing somewhat differing\\nviews of the basis and limits of parental and state educational\\nauthority. While most regard parents as free to educate children into\\ntheir own comprehensive conceptions of the good (CCGs) but obligated\\nto accept the legitimacy of state authority to secure children’s\\ndevelopmental interest in autonomy, an alternative view is that\\nfamilies are no different from public institutions in being barred\\nfrom such “comprehensive enrollment” in CCGs by respect\\nfor free and equal citizenship (Clayton 2006, 2012, 2015). Recent\\ndefenses of public educational authority sometimes follow Gutmann in\\npredicating it on a right or responsibility of constitutional\\ndemocracies to provide for their own futures through civic education,\\nbut they often ground it in a collective responsibility to promote the\\nautonomy foundational to legitimate governance and citizens’\\npursuit of lives that are good for them. These philosophical defenses\\nof state educational authority are , in the sense\\nthat they favor limited and divided educational authority. They side\\nwith Mill in rejecting assertions of parents’ “absolute\\nand exclusive” authority over the education of their own\\nchildren, and they also reject any comparable assertion by states of\\n“absolute and exclusive” or authority over the education of children within their jurisdiction.\\nSuch authority would license an unlimited state role in the provision\\nof education and unlimited regulatory authority over any education the\\nstate does not choose to provide.  \\npluralistic  \\nmonopolistic  \\nWhile (i.e., anarchist or radically libertarian)\\nstances toward state educational authority are comparatively rare\\n(Suissa 2006), philosophical defenses of stances\\nseem to be nonexistent. Contemporary assessments of Ancient Greek\\narguments for a state monopoly on education and Mill’s\\nobjections to a state monopoly (Curren 2000; Gutmann 1987) have led to\\nmuch the same conclusions as contemporary liberal\\nassessments of debates over school choice (Brighouse 2000). Adequate\\npublic provision of education and oversight of private schools and\\nhomeschooling have been defended as requirements of justice, but the\\ndefenses invariably assume that families and other private\\ninstitutions will play largely unregulated roles in the education and\\ndevelopment of children. Advocates of school choice schemes have\\nsometimes presented them as alternatives to a state monopoly on\\nschooling (Friedman 1962), but defenses of school choice have been\\nlargely predicated on predictions of their effects, and philosophical\\ncritiques of school choice have been similarly sensitive to evidence\\nand projections of effects (Ben-Porath & Johanek 2019; Blum 2023;\\nCrouch 2003; W. Feinberg & Lubienski 2008; Swift 2003). Some\\nwillingness to assign educational authority to a mix of private and\\npublic entities on the basis of the likely consequences of such\\nassignments can thus be imputed to both sides of the school choice\\ndebate, even as innovations in school governance, such as charter\\nschools (Blum 2023) have blurred the public-private distinction on\\nwhich much of the debate over educational authority has been\\npredicated.  \\nnihilist  \\nmonopolist  \\npluralist'),\n",

These\\nresponsibilities may be seen as arising largely through voluntary\\nacceptance of the relevant roles, but there are disputes regarding the\\nethical significance of procreation and whether the educational\\nresponsibilities and authority of educators of minor children derive\\nfrom those of parents, derive from those of governments, or may be to\\nsome extent independently grounded (Ahlberg & Cholbi 2017).\\nParents might suppose that teachers in their children’s schools\\nare simply agents to whom they conditionally delegate some of their\\nown educational authority and responsibility, while the best ethical\\nanalysis might be that teachers have independent professional\\nresponsibilities to every student in their care, as well as ethically\\nsignificant responsibilities they incur as government employees. These\\nprofessional and state-actor responsibilities might include ones\\npertaining to civic education, such as cultivating virtues of\\ndemocratic citizenship and promoting civic equality, and ones entailed\\nby the educational provisions of international human rights\\nconventions to which nearly all countries are signatories (i.e.,\\nequitably promoting the individual flourishing of every student;\\nUnited Nations 1948, Art. 26; 1989, Art. 29). Whether or not\\ngovernments in the jurisdictions in question have constitutional and\\nlegal systems that align with liberal-democratic principles of justice\\nor with established human rights provisions, one might see such\\nprinciples or rights as grounding educational responsibilities that\\nstates and state-actors should see themselves as having, even if their\\nnon-ideal circumstances preclude easy enactment of those\\nresponsibilities.

The language of equal educational opportunity\\nsuggests that education is something offered to rational actors, who\\nare at liberty to take advantage of it or not; and from a pedagogical\\nstandpoint it is important that students have some choice in the\\nlearning tasks they undertake.

These considerations suggest that students\\nshould be regarded as having some responsibility to cooperate in their\\neducation. However, it is arguably inappropriate to think of students\\nwho are minor children as fully-formed rational agents who are offered\\nopportunities (Schouten 2023: 189). Motivation and skill in converting\\neducational offerings into desirable attributes are themselves largely\\nproducts of education, and one does not need to be committed to a luck\\negalitarian perspective to think it is wrong to expect children to\\nbear the potentially life-long consequences of making bad educational\\nchoices that could be prevented by adults setting safe boundaries and\\nproviding motivationally sound learning environments.

By\\ncontrast, the idea of EO E is associated with the\\ninherently positional, high-stakes role that educational\\nqualifications have come to play as work and labor markets have been\\ntransformed by the growth of educational systems across the globe.\\nBuilding on the idea that access to desirable positions and offices\\nshould be based strictly on job qualifications,\\nRawls introduced the idea of (FEO), which would require  \\nIs it equal opportunity education or equal\\nopportunity education that matters?  \\nfor  \\nthrough  \\nfor  \\npositional  \\nthrough  \\nbona fide  \\nfair equality of opportunity  \\nnot merely that public offices and social positions be open [to all,\\nin accordance with talent] in the formal sense, but that all should\\nhave a fair chance to attain them…. Those who have the same\\nlevel of [natural] talent and ability and the same willingness to use\\nthese gifts should have the same prospects of success regardless of\\ntheir social class origin, the class into which they are born and\\ndevelop until the age of reason. (Rawls 2001: 73)  \\nRawls argued that FEO would require, among other things, “equal\\nopportunities of education for all regardless of family income”\\n(2001: 44). Some have argued that FEO is an ethically defective\\nmeasure of educational justice because it is impossible to achieve\\nwithout intruding too far into family life and suppressing natural and\\ndesirable differences between children (Gutmann 1987: 131–133).\\nOthers have defended EE as a good that should be pursued within the\\nlimits implied by what is right in such objections (Brighouse 1995;\\nBarry 2005; Levinson, Geron, & Brighouse 2022). The question of\\nhow to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate intrusions into\\nfamily life has been addressed primarily by defining ethical limits to\\nlegitimate parental (i.e., parents’ favoring\\nof their own children in ways that confer competitive advantage)\\n(Macleod 2002; Brighouse & Swift 2009b, 2014).  \\npartiality  \\nThe former would constitute a form of , while the latter would constitute a form of (Rae 1981).

Brian Barry (2005), Gina Schouten (2023) and\\nothers have noted that achieving such global EE would require policies\\nto sharply reduce inequality of family resources.  \\nDoes justice require that governments ensure all children\\nreceive equally good schooling or that all children receive equally\\ngood education in all of its many aspects, both in and outside of\\nschool?  \\nmarginal\\nequality  \\nglobal\\nequality  \\nbona fide  \\nRawlsian FEO would require education that is equal for\\nthe students of an entire country.

The students within a\\nschool? A school district? Municipality? State? Country? The\\nworld?  \\nscope of comparison  \\nStudents will not all benefit equally from the same inputs\\nor from outputs that are —all-purpose\\nmeans to living a good life—so it is important to distinguish equality (i.e., students getting the same\\nthings) with respect to things that may not benefit everyone equally\\nwith equality of benefit (Rae 1981).\\nEthically significant person-regarding measures of EE would include\\nstudent experiences such as experiences of equal respect, a relevant\\nvariety of learning experiences, and childhood pleasures (Levinson,\\nGeron, & Brighouse 2022).  \\nWhat is the relevant of equality?

FEO\\nis a form of block-regarding EE in which children are grouped by\\nsocial class of origin and by “level of [natural] talent and\\nability and the same willingness to use these gifts” (Rawls\\n2001: 73). It has been criticized for its singular focus on equalizing\\nlife-prospects across social classes while tolerating the prospect of\\na self-perpetuating aristocracy of the talented and motivated (D.\\nMiller 1996; Clayton 2001; Satz 2007; Schouten 2012). If the\\nunderlying ethical consideration is that children’s\\nlife-prospects should not be hostage to morally arbitrary luck, then\\nwhy would justice require efforts to compensate children for bad luck\\nin the socio-economic class into which they are born, and not efforts\\nto compensate them for bad luck in their natural endowments (Jencks\\n1988; Harel Ben Shahar 2016; Levinson, Geron, & Brighouse 2022;\\nSchouten 2023)?

For one thing, there are often other forms\\nof justice—such as corrective justice—at stake in\\ndecisions that have distributive significance, and children’s\\nimmaturity and developmental interests are fundamental to the\\nintersection of distributive and corrective justice in education.\\nThere are also matters of relational equality, racial domination,\\nlinguistic justice, educational justice for migrant and working\\nchildren, and others that complicate—or require more\\nthan—a distributional perspective on justice. There are other\\nvalues at stake in educational policies and decisions, such as choice\\nand efficiency, a variety of institutional decision-makers, and a\\nspectrum of granular to system-level decisions that are significant\\nfor justice. A comprehensive theory of educational justice would\\npresumably address all of the diverse forms of injustice that can\\nconverge in educational institutions and practices, and it would\\nideally offer guidance for the full range of educational decisions for\\nwhich considerations of justice are significant. There have been\\ngestures toward such a theory in recent years, including not only work\\non a comprehensive approach to integrating values and evidence in\\neducational decision-making (Brighouse, Ladd et al. 2018), but also\\nwork at the interfaces of inclusion and choice in education (Merry\\n2020), distributive, formative, and corrective justice (Curren 2013),\\nand corrective justice, racial justice, and gender equity in education\\n(Thompson & Tillson 2020, 2023). There have also been efforts to\\nprovide groundwork for a conception of educational justice as justice\\nin the development of children’s potentialities (Thompson 2016),\\nand to develop cases and case analyses in which various aspects of\\neducational justice intersect (Levinson 2023a; Levinson & Fay\\n2016, 2019; Levinson, Geron, et al. 2024; Levinson, Reid, et al.\\n2024).'),\n",

Emerging Issues'}, page_content='The immense volume and range of publications in philosophy of\\neducation in recent years compounds the difficulty inherent in\\nidentifying any handful of recently introduced topics as issues that\\nare “emerging” or destined to be more widely discussed in\\nthe future. Developments in philosophy, education, and the wider world\\nwill all make a difference to the issues that are addressed. Focusing\\non developments in the wider world, climate related mass migration and\\ndevelopments in artificial intelligence will pose philosophically rich\\nquestions about educational justice, civic education, education and\\nwork, and what education should be in a world of AIs. Climate driven\\nmigration and information technology are already civically disruptive\\nforces that figure significantly in the present threats to democracy\\nand educational institutions posed by authoritarian movements,\\nnationalism, and civic polarization. These threats to democracy and\\neducation are already attracting a great deal of attention in\\nphilosophy of education—attention that is informed in varying\\ndegrees by research in social epistemology, political science, and\\nsocial psychology. This work has been mostly focused on free speech,\\nacademic freedom, and accusations of indoctrination, which are the\\nmanifestations of these threats most acutely felt in classrooms and on\\ncampuses.
